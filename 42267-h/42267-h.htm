<h2>RODOLPHUS.&mdash;A FRANCONIA STORY.<br />

<small>BY JACOB ABBOTT.</small></h2>


<h3>CHAPTER III.</h3>

<h4>I. ANTONIO.</h4>

<p>The person who came in so suddenly to help
the boys extinguish the fire under the corn-barn,
on the night of the robbery, was Antonio,
or Beechnut, as the boys more commonly called
him. In order to explain how he came to be
there, we must go back a little in our narrative,
and change the scene of it to Mrs. Henry's house
at Franconia, where Antonio lived.</p>

<p>One morning about a week before the robbery,
Phonny, Mrs. Henry's son, and his cousin Malleville,
who was at that time making a visit at his
mother's, were out upon the back platform at
play, when they saw Antonio walking toward
the barn.</p>

<p>"Children," said Antonio, "we are going into
the field to get a great stone out of the ground.
You may go with us if you like."</p>

<p>"Well;" said Phonny, "come, Malleville, let
us go."</p>

<p>So the children followed Antonio to the barn.
There was a man there, one of Mrs. Henry's
workmen, called James, who was getting out the
oxen. James drove the oxen into the shed, and
there attached them to a certain vehicle called
a drag. This drag was formed of two planks
placed side by side, with small pieces nailed
along the sides and at the ends. The drag was
shaped at the front so as to turn up a little, in
order that it might not catch in the ground when
drawn along. There was a hole in the front part
of the drag for the end of a chain to be passed
through, to draw the drag by. The end of the
chain was fastened by a wooden pin called a <i>fid</i>,
which was passed through the hook or one of
the links, and this prevented the chain from being
drawn back through the hole again.</p>

<p>While James was attaching the oxen to the
drag, Antonio was putting such tools and implements
upon it as would be required for the work.
He put on an iron bar, an ax, a saw, a shovel,
and two spare chains.</p>

<p>"Now, children," said he, "jump on."</p>

<p>So Phonny and Malleville jumped on, and Antonio
with them. Antonio stood in the middle
of the drag, while Phonny and Malleville took
their places on each side of him, and held on by
his arms. James then started the oxen along,
and thus they went into the field.</p>

<p>"And now, Beechnut," said Malleville, "I
wish you would sing me the little song that
Agnes sung when she was dancing on the ice
that summer night."</p>

<p>Phonny laughed aloud at this. "Oh, Malleville!"
said he; "there could not be any ice on
a summer night."</p>

<p>"Yes, there could," said Malleville, in a very
positive tone, "and there was. Beechnut told
me so."</p>

<p>"Oh, that was only one of Beechnut's stories,"
said Phonny, "made up to amuse you."</p>

<p>"Well, I don't care," said Malleville, "I want
to hear the song again."</p>

<p>Beechnut had told Malleville a story about
the fairy Agnes whom he found dancing upon a
fountain one summer night in the woods, having
previously frozen over the surface of the water
with a little silver wand. He had often sung
this song to Malleville, and now she wished to
hear it again. The words of the song, as Beechnut
sang them, were as follows:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">Peep! peep! chippeda dee.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Playing in the moonlight, nobody to see.<br /></span>
<span class="i4">The boys and girls have gone away,<br /></span>
<span class="i4">They've had their playtime in the day<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And now the night is left for me:<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Peep! peep! chippeda dee.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The music was as follows:</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 444px;">
<img src="images/ill-1852-may_illo_01.jpg" width="444" height="478" alt="Music" />
</div>

<p class="center">[<a href="music/harpersmay1852.mid">Listen</a>]</p>

<p>When Beechnut had sung the song Malleville
said, "Again." She was accustomed to say
"again," when she wished to hear Beechnut go
on with his singing, and as she usually liked to
hear such songs a great many times. Beechnut
always continued to sing them, over and over, as
long as she said "again."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_722" id="Page_722">[Pg 722]</a></span>
Thus Malleville kept him singing Agnes's song
in this instance all the way toward the field.</p>

<p>At length Malleville ceased to say "again,"
on account of her attention being attracted to a
bridge which she saw before them, and which it
was obvious they were going to cross. It had
only logs on the sides of it for railing. Beyond
the bridge the road lay along the margin of a
wood. The stone which James and Antonio
were going to get out, was just beyond the bridge,
and almost in the road. When the oxen got
opposite to the stone, James stopped them, and
Antonio and the children got off the drag.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 444px;">
<img src="images/ill-1852-may_illo_02.jpg" width="444" height="551" alt="THE DRAG RIDE." />
<span class="caption">THE DRAG RIDE.</span>
</div>

<p>It was only a small part of the stone that appeared
above the ground. James took the shovel
and began to dig around the place, so as to bring
the stone more fully to view, while Antonio went
into the wood to cut a small tree, in order to make
a lever of the stem of it. Phonny took the saw&mdash;first
asking Antonio's permission to take it&mdash;and
climbed up into a large tree near the margin
of the wood, where he began to saw off a dead
branch which was growing there, and which may
be seen in the picture. Malleville, in the mean
time, sat down upon a square stone which was
lying by the road-side near the wood, and occupied
herself sometimes in watching the operation
of digging out the stone, sometimes in looking
up at Phonny, and sometimes in singing the
song which Antonio had sung to her on the
way.</p>

<p>Presently Antonio, having obtained his lever,
came out into the road with it, and laid it down
by the drag. He looked at the drag in doing
this, and observed that one of the side-pieces had
started up, and that it ought to be nailed down
again. He looked up into the tree where Phonny
was sawing, and said:</p>

<p>"Phonny!"</p>

<p>"What!" said Phonny.</p>

<p>"Look up over your head," said Antonio.
Phonny looked up.</p>

<p>"Do you see that short branch just above
you?"</p>

<p>"This?" said Phonny, putting his hand upon it.</p>

<p>"Yes," said Antonio.</p>

<p>"Yes," said Phonny, "I see
it."</p>

<p>"Hang your saw on it," said
Antonio.</p>

<p>Phonny did so.</p>

<p>"Now, come down from the
tree," said Antonio.</p>

<p>Phonny climbed down as fast
as he could, and came to Beechnut.</p>

<p>"Take all the things out of
your pocket and put them down
on the drag."</p>

<p>Phonny began to take the
things out. First came a pocket
handkerchief. Then a knife handle
without any blades. Then a
fishing line. Then two old coins
and a dark red pebble stone.
This exhausted one pocket.&mdash;From
the other came a small
glass prism, three acorns, and
at last two long nails.</p>

<p>"Ah, that is what I want,"
said Antonio, taking up the nails.
"I thought you had two nails in
your pocket, for I remembered
that I gave you two yesterday.
Will you give them back to me
again?"</p>

<p>"Yes," said Phonny.</p>

<p>"Now, put the things back in
your pocket. I admire a boy that
obeys orders, without stopping to ask why. He
waits till the end, and then he <i>sees</i> why. Now,
you can go back to your saw."</p>

<p>But instead of going back to his saw, Phonny
seemed just at that instant to get a glimpse of
something which attracted his attention along the
road beyond the bridge, for as soon as he had put
his goods and chattels back in his pockets, he
paused a moment, looking in that direction, and
then he set out to run as fast as he could over
the bridge. Antonio looked, and saw that there
was a girl coming along, and that Phonny was
running to meet her.</p>

<p>Antonio wondered who it could be.</p>

<p>It proved to be Ellen Linn. When Malleville
saw that it was Ellen, she ran to meet her. She
asked her why she did not bring Annie with her.</p>

<p>"I did," said Ellen; "she is at the house.
She was tired after walking so far, and so I left
her there."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_723" id="Page_723">[Pg 723]</a></span>
"I am glad that she has come," said Malleville,
"let us go and see her."</p>

<p>"Not just yet," said Ellen. "I will go with
you pretty soon."</p>

<p>The fact was that Ellen had come to see Antonio
about Rodolphus, and now she did not know
exactly how she should manage to have any conversation
with him alone; and she did not wish
to talk before James and all the rest about the
misconduct of her brother. As soon as Antonio
saw her, he went to meet her, and walked with
her up to the place where they were at work, to
show her the great stone that they were digging
out. Ellen looked at it a few minutes and asked
some questions about it, but her thoughts were
after all upon her brother, and not upon the stone.
Presently she went to the place where Malleville
had been sitting, and sat down there. She
thought, perhaps, that Antonio would come there,
and that then she could speak to him.</p>

<p>Phonny climbed up into the tree again, partly
to finish his sawing, and partly to let Ellen Linn
see how well he could work in such a high place.
While he was there, Antonio went to the place
where Ellen Linn was sitting, and asked her if
she had heard from Rodolphus lately.</p>

<p>"Yes," said Ellen, "and that is the very thing
that I came to see you about. I want to talk
with you about Rodolphus."</p>

<p>Ellen said this in a low and desponding voice,
and Antonio knew that she wished to speak to
him alone.</p>

<p>"We can not talk very well here," said Antonio,
"will it do if I come and see you about it
to-night?"</p>

<p>"Yes," said Ellen, looking up joyfully. "Only
I am sorry to put you to that trouble."</p>

<p>"I will come," said Antonio. "I shall get
there about half-past eight."</p>

<p>Pretty soon after this, Ellen Linn went back
to the house, and after a time she and Annie
went home. About a quarter past eight that
evening, she went out into the yard and down to
the gate to watch for Antonio. At length she
saw him coming. When he reached the house,
Ellen walked with him to the great tree in the
middle of the yard, and they both sat down on
the bench by the side of it, while Annie was running
about in the great circular walk, drawing
her cart. Here Antonio and Ellen had a long
conversation about Rodolphus. Ellen said that
she had heard very unfavorable accounts of him.
She had learned that he had got into bad company
in the town where he now lived, as he had
done at home, and that she was afraid that he
was fast going to ruin. She did not know what
could be done, but she thought that perhaps Antonio
might go there and see him, and find out
how the case really was, and perhaps do something
to save her brother.</p>

<p>"I will go, at any rate," said Antonio, "and
see if any thing can be done. Perhaps," he
continued, "Mr. Kerber has found that he is a
troublesome boy and may be willing to give him
up, and then we can get him another place.
However, at all events, I will go and see."</p>

<p>"When can you go?" asked Ellen.</p>

<p>"I can go next Saturday, most conveniently,"
said Antonio. "Besides if I go on Saturday I
can stay till Monday, and that will give me all
of Sunday to see Rodolphus, when he will of
course be at leisure."</p>

<p>So it was arranged that Antonio was to go on
Saturday. Ellen requested him to manage his
expedition as privately as possible, for she did
not wish to have her brother's misconduct made
known more than was absolutely necessary.
Antonio told her that nobody but Mrs. Henry
should know where he was going, and that he
would not even tell her what he was going
for.</p>

<p>That evening Antonio obtained leave of Mrs.
Henry to go to the town where Mr. Kerber lived,
on Saturday, and to be gone until Monday. He
told Mrs. Henry that the business on which he
was going, was private, and that it concerned
other persons, and that on their account, if she
had confidence enough in him to trust him, he
should like to be allowed to go without explaining
what the business was. Mrs. Henry said
that she had perfect confidence in him, and that
she did not wish him to explain the nature of
the business. She surmised, however, that it
was something relating to Rodolphus, for she
knew about his character and history, and she
recollected Ellen's calling at her house to inquire
for Antonio that morning.</p>

<p>When the Saturday arrived, Antonio began
about ten o'clock to prepare for his journey.
He had decided to set out on foot. He thought
that he should get along very comfortably and
well without a horse, as he supposed it would be
easy for him to make bargains with the teamsters
and travelers that would overtake him on the
road, to carry him a considerable part of the
way. He could have taken a horse as well as
not from Mr. Henry's, but as he was to remain in
the place where he was going over Sunday, he
concluded that the expense of keeping the horse
there, if he were to take one, would be more
than he would have to pay to the travelers and
teamsters for carrying him along the road.</p>

<p>He told James that he was going away, and
that he was not to be back again until Monday.
He did not, however, tell him where he was
going. When he was all ready to set out, he
went to his chest and took some money out of
his till&mdash;as much as he thought that he should
need&mdash;and then went into the parlor to tell
Mrs. Henry that he was going.</p>

<p>"Are you all ready, and have you got every
thing that you want?" asked Mrs. Henry.</p>

<p>Antonio said that he had every thing.</p>

<p>"Well, good-by then," said Mrs. Henry. "I
wish you a pleasant journey; and if you find
that any thing occurs so that you think it best
to stay longer than Monday, you can do so."</p>

<p>Antonio thanked Mrs. Henry, bade her good-by,
and went away.</p>

<p>Antonio stopped at Mrs. Linn's as he passed
through the village. He had promised Ellen
that he would call there on his way, to get a letter<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_724" id="Page_724">[Pg 724]</a></span>
which she was going to send, and had told
her at what time he should probably come. He
found Ellen waiting for him at the gate. She
had a small parcel in her hand. When Antonio
came to the gate she showed him the parcel,
and asked him if he could carry such a large
one.</p>

<p>"It is not large at all," said Antonio; "I can
carry it just as well as not."</p>

<p>"It is my little Bible," said she, "and the letter
is inside. It is the Bible that my aunt gave
me; but I thought she would be willing that I
should give it to Rodolphus, if she knew&mdash;"</p>

<p>Here Ellen stopped, without finishing her sentence,
and walked away toward the house. Antonio
looked after her a moment, and then went
away without saying another word.</p>

<p>It was twelve o'clock before he was fairly set
out on his journey. He walked on for about two
hours, meeting with various objects of interest
in the way, but without finding any traveler going
the same way, to help him on his journey.
At last he came to a place where there were two
girls standing by a well before a farm-house.
Antonio, being tired and thirsty, went up to the
well to get a drink.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 444px;">
<img src="images/ill-1852-may_illo_03.jpg" width="444" height="591" alt="THE WELL." />
<span class="caption">THE WELL.</span>
</div>

<p>"How far is it from here to Franconia?" said
Antonio to the girls.</p>

<p>They looked at him as if surprised, but at first
they did not answer.</p>

<p>"Do you know?" said Antonio, speaking again.</p>

<p>"Haven't you just come from Franconia?"
said one of the girls.</p>

<p>"Yes," said Antonio.</p>

<p>"Then I should think that you would know
yourself," said she.</p>

<p>"No," said Antonio, "I don't know. I have
been walking about two hours; but I don't know
how far it is."</p>

<p>"I believe it is about five miles," said the
youngest girl.</p>

<p>"Then I have come two miles and a half an
hour," said Antonio. "It is twenty miles more
that I have got to go."</p>

<p>Then he made a calculation in his mind, and
found that if he should have to walk all the way,
he should not reach the end of his journey till
about eleven o'clock, allowing one hour to stop
for supper and rest.</p>

<p>Antonio thanked the girls for his drink of water
and then went on.</p>

<p>Pretty soon he saw a large wagon in the road
before him. He walked on fast until he overtook
it. He made a bargain with the wagoner to carry
him as far as the wagon was going on his road,
which was about ten miles. This ride rested
him very much, but it did not help him forward
at all in respect to time, for the wagon did not
travel any faster than he would have walked.</p>

<p>At length the wagon came to the place where
it was to turn off from Antonio's road; so Antonio
paid the man the price which had been
agreed upon, and then took to the road again as
a pedestrian.</p>

<p>He walked on about an hour, and then he began
to be pretty tired. He concluded that he
would stop and rest and get some supper at the
very next tavern. It was now about half-past
seven, and he was yet, as he calculated, nearly
eight miles from the end of his journey. Just
then he heard the sound of wheels behind him,
and, on looking round, he saw a light wagon
coming, drawn by a single horse, and with but
one man in the wagon. The wagon was coming
on pretty rapidly, but Antonio determined to stop
it as it passed; so he stood at one side of the
road, and held up his hand as a signal, when the
wagon came near.</p>

<p>The man stopped. On inquiry Antonio found
that he was going directly to the town where
Rodolphus lived. Antonio asked the man what
he would ask to carry him there.</p>

<p>"What may I call your name?" said the man.</p>

<p>"My name is Antonio."</p>

<p>"And my name is Antony," said the man.
"Antony. It is a remarkable coincidence that
our names should be so near alike. Get in here
with me and ride on to the tavern, we will see if
we can make a trade."</p>

<p>Antonio found Antony a very amusing and
agreeable companion. In the end it was agreed
that they should stop at the tavern and have some
supper, and that Antonio should pay for the supper
for both himself and Antony, and in consideration
of that, he was to be carried in the wagon
to the end of his journey.</p>

<p>During the supper and afterward, while riding
along the road, Antony was quite inquisitive to
learn all about Antonio, and especially to ascertain
what was the cause of his taking that journey.
But Antonio resisted all these attempts,
and would give no information whatever in respect
to his business.</p>

<p>They reached the end of their journey about
half-past nine o'clock. Antonio was set down at
the tavern, which has already been spoken of as
situated at the head of the lane leading to the
corn-barn, where Rodolphus and the other boys<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_725" id="Page_725">[Pg 725]</a></span>
had made their rendezvous. Immediately after
being shown to his room, which it happened
was a chamber on the side of the house which
was toward the lane, Antonio came down stairs
and went out. His plan was to proceed directly
to Mr. Kerber's house, hoping to be able to see
Rodolphus that evening. He was afraid before
he left the tavern that it might be too late, and
that he should find they had all gone to bed at
Mr. Kerber's. He thought, however, that he
could tell whether the family were still up, by the
light which he would in that case see at the windows;
and he concluded that if the house should
appear dark, he would not knock at the door, but
go back to the tavern, and wait till the next
morning.</p>

<p>The house <i>was</i> dark, and so Antonio, after
standing and looking at it a few moments with a
disappointed air, went back to the tavern. He
went in at the door, and went up to his room.
It happened that no one saw him go into the
tavern this time, for as there was a very bright
moon, and it shone directly into his chamber-window,
he thought that he should not need a
lamp to go to bed by, so he went directly up stairs
to his room.</p>

<p>It was now about ten o'clock. Antonio sat
down by his window and looked out. It was a
beautiful evening, and he sat some time enjoying
the scene. At length he heard suppressed
voices, and looking down he saw three boys come
stealing along round the corner of a fence and
enter a lane. He saw the light of a lantern, too,
for he was up so high that he could look down
into it, as it were. He was convinced at once
from these indications that there was something
going on that was wrong.</p>

<p>He listened attentively, and thought that he
could recognize Rodolphus's voice, and he was
at once filled with apprehension and anxiety. He
immediately took his cap, and went softly down
stairs, and out at the door, and then going round
into the lane, he followed the boys down toward
the corn-barn. When they had all got safely in,
underneath the building, he crept up softly to the
place, and looking through a small crack in the
boards he saw and heard all that was going on;
he overheard the conversation between the boys
about the box, saw them take away the straw,
dig the hole, and bury it, and then had just time
to step round the corner of the barn, and conceal
himself, when the boys came out to see if the
way was clear for them to go home. The next
moment the light from the burning straw broke
out, and Antonio, without stopping to think, ran
instinctively in among the boys to help them to
put out the fire.</p>

<p>Of course when the boys fled he was left there
alone, and he soon found that it would be impossible
for him to extinguish the fire. It spread so
rapidly over the straw and among the boxes, that
it was very plain all his efforts to arrest the progress
of it would be unavailing. In the mean time
he began to hear the cry of "fire." The people of
the tavern had been the first to see the light, and
were running to the spot down the lane. It suddenly
occurred to Antonio that if he were found
there at the fire he should be obliged to explain
how he came there, and by so doing to expose
Rodolphus as a thief and a burglar.<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> When Antonio
thought how broken-hearted Ellen would
be to have her brother sent to prison for such
crimes, he could not endure the thought of being
the means of his detection. He immediately determined
therefore to run away, and leave the
people to find out how the fire originated as they
best could.</p>

<p>All these thoughts passed through Antonio's
mind in an instant, and he sprang out from under
the corn-barn as soon as he heard the men coming,
and ran off toward the fields. The men saw
him, and they concluded immediately that he was
an incendiary who had set the building on fire,
and accordingly the first two that came to the
spot instead of stopping to put out the fire, determined
to pursue the fugitive. Antonio ran to
a place where there was a gap in a wall, and,
leaping over, he crouched down, and ran along
on the outer side of the wall. The men followed
him. Antonio made for a haystack which was
near, and after going round to the further side of
the haystack, he ran on toward a wood, keeping the
haystack between himself and the men, in hopes
that he should thus be concealed from their view.
As soon as he got into the wood he ran into a
little thicket, and creeping into the darkest place
that he could find, he lay down there to await the
result.</p>

<p>The men came up to the place out of breath
with running. They looked about in the wood
for some time, and Antonio began to think that
they would not find him. But he was mistaken.
One of the men at length found him, and pulled
him out roughly by the arms.</p>

<p>They took hold of him, one on one side and
the other on the other, and led him back toward
the fire. The building was by this time all in
flames, and though many men had assembled
they made no effort to extinguish the fire. It
was obvious, in fact, that all such efforts would
have been unavailing. Then, besides, as the
building stood by itself, there was no danger to
any other property, in letting it burn. The men
gathered round Antonio, wondering who he could
be, but he would not answer any questions. He
was there an utter stranger to them all&mdash;a prisoner,
seized almost in the very act of setting the
building on fire, and yet he stood before them
with such an open, fearless, honest look, that no
one knew what to think or to say in respect to him.</p>

<p>In the mean time the flames rolled fearfully
into the air, sending up columns of sparks, and
illuminating all the objects around in the most
brilliant manner. Groups of boys stood here and
there, their faces brightened with the reflection
of the fire, and their arms held up before their
eyes to shield them from the dazzling light. A
little further back were companies of women and
children, beaming out beautifully from the surrounding<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_726" id="Page_726">[Pg 726]</a></span>
darkness, and a gilded vane on the village
spire appeared relieved against the sky, as
if it were a great blazing meteor at rest among
the stars. At length the fire went down. The
people gradually dispersed. The men who had
charge of Antonio took him to the tavern, locked
him up in a room there, and stationed one of
their number to keep guard at the door till morning.</p>

<h4><br />II. ANTONIO A PRISONER.</h4>

<p>During the night, Antonio had time to reflect
upon the situation in which he was placed, and
to consider what it was best for him to do. He
decided that the first thing to be done, was to
write to Mrs. Henry, and inform her what had
happened. He determined also not to reveal
any thing against Rodolphus, unless he should
find that he was required by law to do so&mdash;at
least until he could have time to consider whether
something could not yet be done to save him from
the utter ruin which would follow from his being
convicted of burglary and sent to the state
prison.</p>

<p>In the morning, an officer came with a regular
warrant for arresting Antonio, on the charge of
setting the corn-barn on fire. A warrant is a
paper signed by a justice or judge, authorizing
the officer to seize a prisoner, and to bring him
before a magistrate, for what is called an examination.
If, on the examination, the magistrate
sees that the prisoner is clearly innocent, he
releases him, and that is the end of the matter.
If, however, he finds that there is reason to suspect
that he may be guilty, he orders the officer
to keep him in the jail till the time comes for the
court to meet and try his case.</p>

<p>Sometimes, when the offense is not very serious,
they release the prisoner <i>on bail</i>,
as it is called, during the time that
intervenes between his examination
and his trial. That is, they give him
up to his friends, on condition that
his friends agree that he shall certainly
appear at the time of trial&mdash;covenanting
that if he does not appear they
will pay a large sum of money. The
money that is to be forfeited, if he
fails to appear, varies in different
cases, and is fixed by the judge in
each particular case. This money is
called the <i>bail</i>. If the prisoner has
a bad character, and his friends generally
believe that he is guilty, he can
not get bail, for his friends are afraid
that if they give bail for him, and so
let him have his liberty, he will run
away before the time comes for his
trial, and then they will lose the
money. When, for this or any other
reason, a prisoner can not get bail,
he has to go to prison, and stay there
till his trial comes on. On the other
hand, if the prisoner has a good character,
and if his friends have confidence
in him, they give bail, and thus
he is left at liberty until his trial
comes on.</p>

<p>At the examination of a prisoner,
which takes place usually very soon
after he is first arrested, he is allowed to say any
thing that he pleases to say, in explanation of the
suspicious circumstances under which he was
taken. He is, however, not required to say any
thing unless he chooses. The reason of this is,
that no one is required to furnish any proof
against himself, when he is charged with crime.
If he can say any thing which will operate in his
favor, he is allowed to do it, and what he says
is written down, and is produced on his trial, to
be used for or against him according to the circumstances
of the case.</p>

<p>When the officer came in, in the morning, to arrest
Antonio, he told him he was to go at eleven
o'clock the next morning before the magistrate to
be examined. Antonio asked the officer whether
he could be allowed, in the mean time, to write
a letter to his friends in Franconia.</p>

<p>"Yes," said the officer, "only I must see what
you write."</p>

<p>So they brought Antonio a sheet of paper, and
a pen and ink. He sat down to a table and
wrote as follows:</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="right">"<span class="smcap">Hiburgh</span>, July 10.</p>

<p>"To <span class="smcap">Mrs. Henry</span>;</p>

<p>"There was a fire here last night which burnt
up an old corn-barn, and I have been taken up
for it, by the officers. They think that I set the
corn-barn on fire, but I did not do it. I suppose,
though, that I shall have to be tried, and I expect
that I must go to prison until the trial comes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_727" id="Page_727">[Pg 727]</a></span>
on, unless Mr. Keep could come down here and
make some arrangement for me. You may depend
that I did not set the corn-barn on fire.</p>

<p class="right"><span style="margin-right: 3em;">"Yours with much respect,</span><br />
"<span class="smcap">A. Bianchinette</span>."</p>

</blockquote>

<p>The officer read this letter when it was finished,
and then asked Antonio whether it should
be put into the post-office. Antonio inquired
how much it would cost to send a boy with it on
purpose. The officer told him what he thought
it would cost, and then Antonio took out the
money that he had in his pocket to see if he had
enough. He found that he had more than enough,
and so the officer sent a special messenger with
the letter.</p>

<p>"And now," said the officer, "you must go
with me to my house. I am going to keep you
there until the examination to-morrow."</p>

<p>So Antonio took his cap and went down stairs
with the officer. He found quite
a number of men and boys at
the door, waiting to see him
come. These people followed
him along through the street, as
he walked toward the officer's
house, some running before, to
look him in the face, and some
running behind, and calling
him incendiary and other hard
names. Antonio took no notice
of them, but walked quietly
along, talking with the officer.</p>

<p>When he got opposite to the
lane, he looked down toward the
place where the corn-barn had
stood. He found that it had
been burnt to the ground. The
ruins were still smoking, and
several men and boys were
standing around the place&mdash;some
looking idly on, and some
poking up the smouldering fires.</p>

<p>There was something in Antonio's
frank and honest air, and
in the intelligence and good sense which he
manifested in his conversation, which interested
the officer in his favor. He told his wife
when he got home that Antonio was the most
honest looking rogue that he ever had the
custody of. It shows, however, he added, how
little we can trust to appearances. I once had
a man in my keeping, who looked as innocent
and simple-minded as Dorinda there, but he
turned out to be one of the most cunning counterfeiters
in the state.</p>

<p>Dorinda was the officer's little girl.</p>

<p>There was a room in the officer's house, which
was made very strong, and used for the temporary
keeping of prisoners. They put Antonio
into this room and locked him in.</p>

<p>The officer, however, told him when he went
away, that he would bring him some breakfast
pretty soon; and this he did in about half an
hour. Antonio ate his breakfast with an excellent
appetite.</p>

<p>After breakfast he moved his chair up to a
small window, which had been made in one side
of the room. The window had a sash on the
inside, and great iron bars without. Antonio
opened the sash and looked out through the iron
bars. He saw a pleasant green yard, and a little
girl playing there upon the grass.</p>

<p>"What is your name?" said Antonio.</p>

<p>The little girl started at hearing this voice,
ran back a little way, and then stood looking at
Antonio with her hands behind her.</p>

<p>"Bring me that piece of paper," said Antonio,
"that lies there on the grass, and I will make
you a picture."</p>

<p>The girl stood still a moment as if much
astonished, and then advancing timidly, she
picked up the paper and brought it to Antonio's
window, which was very near the ground, and
held it up. Antonio reached his arm out between
the bars of the grating and took the paper in.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 509px;">
<img src="images/ill-1852-may_illo_05.jpg" width="509" height="444" alt="THE BARRED WINDOW." />
<span class="caption">THE BARRED WINDOW.</span>
</div>

<p>Although the window was not high, it seemed
to be with some difficulty that Antonio could
reach the paper as Dorinda held it up. But this
was partly because Dorinda was afraid, and did
not dare to come too near.</p>

<p>Antonio took a pencil out of his pocket, and
putting the paper down upon the window sill, he
began to draw. Dorinda stood still upon the
ground outside, watching him. Antonio made a
picture of a very grave and matronly-looking cat,
lying upon a stone step and watching two kittens
that were playing upon the grass before her.
There was a bare-headed boy near, who seemed
to be putting a mitten upon his hand. Underneath
Antonio wrote the words&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"This is the picture of a cat,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Looking at some kittens;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Also a boy without a hat,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Putting on his mittens."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<span class="caption">ANTONIO'S PICTURE.</span>
</div>

<p>When the work was finished, Antonio threw
the paper out the window, and Dorinda who had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_728" id="Page_728">[Pg 728]</a></span>
been all the time looking on with a very serious
expression of countenance, took it up, and began
to look at the drawing. She could not read, so
she only looked at the picture. After examining
it for some minutes, without, however, at all relaxing
the extreme gravity of her countenance,
she ran off to show the paper to her mother.</p>

<p>Presently she came back again. By this time
Antonio had made another drawing. It was the
representation of his own window, as it would
appear on the outside, with iron bars forming a
grating, and himself looking through between
them. Underneath he wrote,</p>

<p>"Pity the poor prisoner, and bring him some
books to read."</p>

<p>Dorinda took this picture too, when Antonio
threw it out to her, and ran in with it to her mother.
Presently she came out with two books
in her hand. She came under the window and
held them up timidly to Antonio, and Antonio
took them in.</p>

<p>By the help of these books and some other indulgences
that the officer allowed him, Antonio
got through the day very comfortably and well.</p>

<p>The next morning, at eleven o'clock, the officer
came to take his prisoner to the justice, for
examination. The officer led Antonio along the
street till he came to a lawyer's office. There
were several men and boys about the door.
These persons eyed Antonio very closely when
he went in. On entering the office, Antonio
was brought up in front of a table which stood
in the middle of the room. A young man was
sitting at the table with paper, and pen, and ink
before him. He was the clerk. The justice
himself sat in an arm-chair near the window.</p>

<p>The men and boys from the outside came in
immediately after Antonio, and stood in the office,
near the door, to hear the examination.</p>

<p>When all was ready, the justice commenced
by saying to Antonio,</p>

<p>"What is your name?" young man.</p>

<p>"Antonio Bianchinette," said Antonio.</p>

<p>"Where do you live?" asked the justice.</p>

<p>"In Franconia," said Antonio.</p>

<p>"You are aware, I suppose," said the justice,
"that you are charged with having set fire to
the building which was burned night before last,
and you are brought here for a preliminary examination.
You can do just as you please about
giving any explanation of the circumstances of
the case, or answering any questions that I put
to you. If you make any statements or answer
any questions, what you say will be put down,
and will be used either for, or against you, as
the case may be, on your trial."</p>

<p>Antonio said in reply, that he did not wish to
make any statements, or to answer any questions
in relation to the fire.</p>

<p>"There is one thing, however," he added, "that
I wish to say, and that is, that there is something
buried in the ground, under the place where the
building stood, that ought to be dug up, and if
you will take me to the place I will show you
where to dig."</p>

<p>"What is it that is buried there?" said the
justice.</p>

<p>"I would rather not answer that question,"
said Antonio.</p>

<p>The justice paused a moment to consider what
to do. He had heard of the robbery that had
been committed on Saturday night, for Mr. Kerber,
on going into his office on Monday morning,
had found the back door unhasped, and his desk
broken open, and the news of the robbery had
spread all over the village. People wondered
whether there could be any connection between
the robbery and the fire, though nothing had been
said to Antonio about it.</p>

<p>After thinking a moment about Antonio's proposal,
the justice concluded to accede to it. The
officer accordingly sent a man to get a spade and
directed him to come with it to the ruins of the
corn-barn. Another man went to tell Mr. Kerber
that the boy who had been taken up for setting
the barn on fire, had said that there was
something buried there, and that perhaps it might
prove to be his money-box. So Mr. Kerber determined
to go and see.</p>

<p>In a short time quite a large party were assembled
around the ruins. Antonio directed
them where to dig. The men pulled away the
blackened timbers and brands which were lying
over the spot, and began to dig into the ground.
In a few minutes they struck something hard
with the spade, and setting the spade down beneath
it so as to pry it out, they found that it
was indeed Mr. Kerber's box.</p>

<p>The men gathered eagerly around to examine
the box. Mr. Kerber shook it and found that
the money was safe inside. He took out his key,
but he could not get it into the key-hole, for the
key-hole had got filled with earth. He turned
the box down upon its side and knocked it upon
something hard, and so got the earth out, and
then he found that the key would go in. He unlocked
the box, and to his great joy found that
all was safe.</p>

<p>Antonio would not make any explanation, except
that he did not suppose that any thing else
was buried there, and that consequently it would
do no good to dig any more. He said, moreover,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_729" id="Page_729">[Pg 729]</a></span>
that he expected some of his friends would
come from Franconia before night to see about
his case, and so the justice gave him up to the
care of the officer again, until his friends should
come. The officer accordingly took his prisoner
away again, and Mr. Kerber carried his money-box
home.</p>

<p>Mr. Keep arrived that day about noon. He
immediately had an interview with Antonio.
After some little general conversation, Antonio
said that he would rather not make any explanations
of the circumstances under which he was
arrested at present, even to Mr. Keep, unless
Mr. Keep requested it.</p>

<p>"I tell you truly, sir," said he, "that I am
entirely innocent: but I can not state what I
know, without breaking a poor girl's heart who
once saved my life, and I can not do it."</p>

<p>Mr. Keep was silent a few minutes when Antonio
said this. He recollected Rodolphus and
Ellen his sister, and recalled to mind the story
of Ellen and the snow-shoes, which he had heard
at the time. He immediately understood the
whole case.</p>

<p>"I am not surprised that you feel as you do,"
said he, "but when a crime is committed and we
are called upon to testify as a witness, we are
bound to state what we know, without regard to
our private feelings."</p>

<p>"Yes, sir," said Antonio, "but I
am not called upon as a witness. I
am charged with committing the
crime myself, and the justice said
that I was at liberty to answer or
not, as I chose."</p>

<p>Mr. Keep was silent for a moment.
He seemed to be reflecting upon what
Rodolphus had said.</p>

<p>"By taking the course that you
propose," he added, at length, "you
run a great risk of being condemned
yourself for the crime."</p>

<p>"Why, no, sir," said Antonio; "I
can't be condemned unless they <i>prove</i>
that I did it; and as I really did not
do it, I don't think that they can
prove that I did."</p>

<p>Mr. Keep smiled.</p>

<p>"Well suppose that you do as
you propose," said Mr. Keep, "and
allow yourself to take the place of
the one who is really guilty, what
good will it do him? You will only
leave him to commit more crimes."</p>

<p>"I hope not, sir," said Antonio
"I should try to get him away from
here to some new place. I think
that he has been led away. He has
got into bad company."</p>

<p>"Well," said Mr. Keep, after a short pause,
"the plan may succeed, but you run a great risk
in taking such a course. I think that there is
great danger that you would be condemned and
sent to the state prison."</p>

<p>"Well," said Beechnut, "I should not mind
that very much. There is no great harm in going
to prison, if you are only innocent. I have
been shut up here one day already, and I had a
good time."</p>

<p>Mr. Keep said finally that the subject required
time for consideration, and that in the mean time
he would make arrangements for giving bail for
Antonio. This he did, and then he and Antonio
went together back to Franconia.</p>

<h4>III. THE TRIAL.</h4>

<p>The time arrived for Antonio's trial very soon.
At the appointed day he and Mr. Keep went together
to the town where the court was to be held.</p>

<p>Mr. Keep delivered Antonio to the officer
again, and the officer led him into a little room
adjoining the court room and left him there
under the custody of a subordinate officer. At
length his case was called, and the officer came
forward and conducted him into the court room.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 444px;">
<img src="images/ill-1852-may_illo_07.jpg" width="444" height="480" alt="THE COURT ROOM." />
<span class="caption">THE COURT ROOM.</span>
</div>

<p>When Antonio entered the room he looked
around to see how it was arranged. At one end
there was a platform, with a curtained window
behind it, and a long desk in front. Behind the
desk there sat an elderly gentleman whom Antonio
supposed was the judge. He sat in a large
arm-chair. There was another arm-chair upon
the platform, but there was nobody sitting in it.
Antonio thought that probably it was for another
judge, and that he would come in by-and-by, but
he did not come.</p>

<p>In front of the judge's desk and a little lower
down, there was another desk, with a great many
books and bundles of papers upon it. There was
a man seated at this desk with his back to the
judge's desk. This man was writing. He was
the clerk of the court.</p>

<p>In front of the clerk's desk, and toward the
middle of the room was a pretty large table with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_730" id="Page_730">[Pg 730]</a></span>
lawyers sitting around it. The lawyers had green
bags with papers in them.</p>

<p>On each side of the room there were two long
seats facing toward the middle of the room.
These seats were for the juries. Each seat was
long enough for six men, making twelve in all
on each side. Between the juries' seats and the
judge's platform, there was, on each side, a stand
for the witnesses. The witnesses' stands were
placed in this position, so that all could hear the
testimony which the witnesses should give.</p>

<p>On the back side of the room there were several
seats for spectators. In front of the spectator's
seats there were two chairs. The officer
led Antonio to one of these chairs and gave him
a seat there. The officer himself took his seat
in the other chair. He had a long slender pole
in his hand, which was his badge of office.</p>

<p>The first thing to be done was for the clerk to
read the accusation. The accusation to be made
against a prisoner is always written out in full,
and is called an indictment. The indictment
against Antonio was handed to the clerk and he
read it. It charged Antonio with breaking into
and robbing Mr. Kerber's office, and then setting
fire to the barn.</p>

<p>After the indictment had been read, the judge,
looking to Antonio, asked him whether he was
guilty or not guilty.</p>

<p>"Not guilty," said Antonio.</p>

<p>The arrangements were then made for the
trial. The jury were appointed, and they took
their places in the jury seats which were on the
right hand side of the court room. Some jury-men
belonging to another jury were sitting in
the seats on the left hand, but they had now nothing
to do but to listen, like the other spectators.</p>

<p>There is a sort of public lawyer in every county,
appointed for the purpose, whose business it
is to attend to the trial of any person accused of
crime in his county. He is called the county
attorney. It is his duty to collect the evidence
against the prisoner, and to see that it is properly
presented to the court and jury, and to prove that
the prisoner is guilty, if he can. The prisoner,
on the other hand has another lawyer, whose
duty it is to collect all the evidence in his favor,
and to try to prove him innocent. The trial is always
commenced by adducing first the evidences
of the prisoner's guilt.</p>

<p>Accordingly, when the jury were ready, the
judge called upon the county attorney to proceed.</p>

<p>He rose, and spoke as follows:</p>

<p>"May it please your Honor."</p>

<p>Here the county attorney bowed to the judge.</p>

<p>"And you, gentlemen of the jury."</p>

<p>Here he bowed to the jury.</p>

<p>"I am very sorry to have to appear against so
young, and, I may add, so innocent-looking a person
as the prisoner before you, on a charge of so
serious a nature as burglary. But I have no
choice. However much we may regret that a
person so young should become so depraved as
to commit such crimes, our duty to the community
requires that we should proceed firmly and
decidedly to the exposure and punishment of
them. I shall proceed to lay before you the evidence
that the prisoner at the bar is guilty of the
crime charged against him. It will be the duty
of his counsel, on the other hand, to prove his
innocence, if he can. I shall be very glad, and I
have no doubt that you will be, to find that he
can succeed in doing this. I fear, however, that
it will be out of his power.</p>

<p>"I shall prove to you, gentlemen of the jury, by
the witnesses that I shall bring forward, that the
prisoner left his home in a very mysterious manner
on the Saturday when the robbery was committed.
That he came to Hiburgh, and arrived
here about nine o'clock. That he then went to
his room, as if to go to bed, and immediately
afterward went out in a secret manner. About
half-past ten the corn-barn was found to be on
fire; and on the people repairing to the spot,
found the prisoner there alone. He fled, and was
pursued. He was taken, and at length finding
that he was detected, and terrified, perhaps, at
the consequences of what he had done, he gave
information of the place where the money which
had been taken was concealed.</p>

<p>"These circumstances all point to the prisoner
as the guilty party, or at least as one of the guilty
parties concerned in the robbery. As to the fire,
we lay no particular stress upon that, for it may
have been accidental. We think it probable that
it was so. The charge which we make against
the prisoner is the robbery, and we are willing to
consider the fire as an accident, providentially
occurring as a means of bringing the iniquity to
light."</p>

<p><br />
The county attorney then began to call in his
witnesses. The first witness was James.</p>

<p>James said that Antonio was well known to
him; that he came originally from Canada; that
he had lived for some time at Mrs. Henry's; and
that on the Saturday in question he said that he
was going to Hiburgh; but would not give him,
James, any explanation of the business that called
him there.</p>

<p>The next witness was Antony, the man who
had brought Antonio in his wagon the last part
of his journey.</p>

<p>Antony testified that he overtook the prisoner
on the road, and that he brought him forward in
his wagon. The prisoner, he said, seemed very
anxious to get into town before nine o'clock; but
he was very careful not to say any thing about
the business which called him there. There was
something very mysterious about him, Antony
said, and he thought so at the time.</p>

<p>The next witness was the tavern keeper.</p>

<p>The tavern-keeper testified that Antonio came
to his house a little past nine; that he seemed in
a hurry to go to his room, that the tavern-keeper
showed him the room and left him there; but that
on going up a few minutes afterward to ask him
what time he would have breakfast, he found that
he was not there. That about an hour afterward
he saw a light, and running out he found that the
corn-barn was on fire. He cried "fire," and with
another man ran to the corn-barn, and there saw<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_731" id="Page_731">[Pg 731]</a></span>
some one running away. He and the other man
pursued the fugitive, and finally caught him, and
found that it was the prisoner&mdash;the same young
man that had come to his house as a traveler an
hour before.</p>

<p>The next witness was Mr. Kerber.</p>

<p>Mr. Kerber testified that he left his office safe,
with his money in the money-box, in the desk,
on Saturday night, about half-past eight. That
on the Monday morning following he found that
the office had been broken into, the desk opened,
and the money-box carried away. That he was
present at the prisoner's examination before the
justice, and that the prisoner then and there said
that there was something buried under where the
corn-barn had stood, and that the company all
proceeded to the place, and dug into the ground
where the prisoner directed them to dig, and that
there they found the money-box.</p>

<p>The minutes of Antonio's examination before
the justice were also read, in which he declined
to give any explanation of the case.</p>

<p>The county attorney then said that his evidence
was closed.</p>

<p>The judge then called upon Mr. Keep to bring
forward whatever evidence he had to offer in the
prisoner's favor. Mr. Keep had only two witnesses,
and they could only testify to Antonio's
general good character. They were Franconia
men, who said that they had known Antonio a
long time, that he had always borne an irreproachable
character, and that they did not believe him
capable of committing such a crime.</p>

<p>After the evidence was thus all in, Mr. Keep
made a speech in defense of his client. He admitted,
he said, that the case was a very extraordinary
one. There was a mystery about it
which was not explained. Still he said it was
not really <i>proved</i>, either that Antonio stole the
money or that he set fire to the barn. Many
suppositions might be made to account for the
facts, without implicating Antonio as really guilty.</p>

<p>The county attorney then made his speech.
It was, of course, against Antonio. He said
that the appearances were all against the prisoner,
and that if he were really innocent, it would
be easy for him to explain the case. His refusal
to do this, and his showing where the money was
hid, ought to be considered as completing the
proofs of guilt, furnished by the other circumstances
of the affair.</p>

<p>The judge then told the jury that it was their
duty to decide whether it had been <i>proved</i> that
Antonio was guilty.</p>

<p>"You have heard all the evidence," said he,
"and you must decide. If you are perfectly satisfied
that the prisoner is guilty, then you must
condemn him. If you are satisfied that he is
innocent, then of course you must acquit him.
And if you are uncertain whether he is innocent
or guilty, then you must acquit him too; for no
one is to be condemned, unless it is proved positively
that he is guilty."</p>

<p>The jury were then conducted out by an officer
of the court, to a small room adjoining, where
they were to deliberate on the case. In about
fifteen minutes they returned. The judge then
called upon the prisoner to rise. Antonio rose
and looked toward the judge. The jury were
standing in their places, looking toward the
judge, too.</p>

<p>"Gentlemen of the jury," said the judge, "are
you agreed upon the verdict?"</p>

<p>The foreman of the jury said,</p>

<p>"We are agreed."</p>

<p>"Gentlemen of the jury," said the judge again,
"what say you? is the prisoner guilty or not
guilty?"</p>

<p>"Not guilty," said the foreman.</p>

<p>There was general smile of satisfaction about
the room at hearing this decision. The clerk
wrote down the verdict in the record. The judge
directed the prisoner to be discharged, and then
called for the case which came next on the
docket.<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a></p>

<p>Antonio went out with Mr. Keep and got into
a wagon which Mr. Keep had provided all ready
for him at the door. They set out, counsel and
client, on their return to Franconia.</p>

<p>Mr. Keep was of course very much relieved
at the result of the trial; for though he was
himself perfectly satisfied of his client's innocence,
still the circumstances were very strong
against him, and there was, in fact, nothing but
his good character in his favor. He had been
very much afraid, therefore, that Antonio would
be condemned, for the jury are bound to decide
according to the evidence that is placed before
them.</p>

<p>"You have got off very well, so far," said
Mr. Keep. "Having been accused as an accomplice
in the crime, it was your privilege to
be silent. Should you, however, hereafter be
called upon as a witness, you will have to give
your testimony."</p>

<p>"Why must I?" asked Antonio.</p>

<p>"Your duty to your country requires it," said
Mr. Keep.</p>

<p>"Then," said Antonio, "I suppose I must,
and I will."</p>

<h4>IV. ANOTHER TRIAL.</h4>

<p>Rodolphus and his two confederates in crime
were in a state of great anxiety and apprehension,
during the period which intervened between
the committing of the crime and the trial of Antonio.
Antonio did not attempt to hold any communication
with Rodolphus during this interval,
for fear that by so doing he might awaken in
people's minds some suspicion of the truth. He
had, however, a secret plan of doing something
to save Rodolphus from ruin, so soon as the excitement,
which had been occasioned by the robbery
and the fire, should have passed by. All
his plans however were defeated by an unexpected
train of occurrences, which took place a
day or two after his acquittal, and which changed
suddenly the whole aspect of the affair.</p>

<p>One night very soon after Antonio's trial, Rodolphus,
after he had gone to bed and was just
falling asleep, was awakened by a loud knocking
at his door.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_732" id="Page_732">[Pg 732]</a></span>
"Rodolphus!" said a harsh voice, outside,
"Rodolphus! get up and let us in."</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 491px;">
<img src="images/ill-1852-may_illo_08.jpg" width="491" height="444" alt="THE ARREST" />
<span class="caption">THE ARREST</span>
</div>

<p>Rodolphus was dreadfully terrified. He was
always terrified by any unexpected sight or sound,
as the guilty usually are. He got up and opened
the door. Mr. Kerber and another man came in.</p>

<p>"You are my prisoner," said the stranger.
"You must put on your clothes and come with
me."</p>

<p>Rodolphus was in great distress and trepidation.
He however put on his clothes. He did
not dare to ask what he was arrested for. He
knew too well. The officer informed him that
he was arrested on a charge of being concerned
in the robbery of Mr. Kerber, but that he need
not say any thing about it unless he chose to do
so. Rodolphus was so terrified and distressed
that he did not know what to say or do. So the
officer led him away, pale and trembling, to his
house, and locked him up in the same room
where Antonio had been confined. There was
a little bed in one corner of the room. Rodolphus
went and sat down upon it, and sobbed
and wept in anguish and despair.</p>

<p>In a day or two his friends in Franconia heard
of his arrest, and Mr. Keep went down to see
him. Mr. Keep came as Rodolphus's counsel
and friend&mdash;in order to confer with him and to
defend him on his trial; but Rodolphus considered
him as banded with all the rest of the world
against him, and either could not, or would not
answer any of the friendly questions which Mr.
Keep proposed to him; but sat crying all the
time while Mr. Keep was there, and making
himself very miserable. Mr. Keep saw at once
that he was guilty, and despaired of being able
to do any thing to save him.</p>

<p>There was nobody to give bail for Rodolphus,
and so it was necessary to keep him in close
confinement until the time for his trial arrived.
In consideration, however, of his tender years,
it was decided not to take him to the jail, but to
keep him at the house of the officer, in the strong
room where he was put when he was first arrested.</p>

<p>The room itself was a very comfortable
one, but Rodolphus spent
his time in it very unhappily. The
people treated him very kindly, but
nothing gave him any peace or comfort.
They brought him books, but
he could not read well enough to
take any pleasure in them. Sometimes
he would go to the window
and look out upon the green yard,
but it only made him more miserable
to see the grass and the flowers,
and the trees waving in the wind,
and the birds flying about at liberty.
Sometimes he saw Dorinda there
playing with her kitten, and singing
little songs; but this sight made
him more unhappy than all the rest.</p>

<p>Rodolphus's mother came down to
to see him once, with Antonio. Antonio
drove down with her in a wagon.
The visit, however, did not give
either Rodolphus or his mother any
pleasure. They spoke scarcely a word to each
other, while she staid. When she got into the
wagon to go home, Antonio, seeing how much
she was distressed, tried to comfort her by saying,
that she must not be so troubled; he hoped,
he said, that Rodolphus would yet turn out to be
a good boy. There had been a great many cases,
where boys had been led away when young, by
bad company, to do what was very wrong, who
were afterward sorry for it, and changed their
courses and behaved well. This conversation
seemed to make Mrs. Linn feel somewhat more
composed, but she was still very unhappy.</p>

<p>At length the time for the trial drew near.
Rodolphus felt great solicitude and anxiety as
the time approached. He did not know what
evidence there was against him, for no one had
been allowed to talk with him on the subject of
the crime. Even Mr. Keep, his lawyer, did not
know what the evidence was, for it is always
customary in such cases, for each party to keep
the evidence which they have to offer, as much
as possible concealed. Antonio had, however,
received a summons to appear as a witness, and
Mr. Keep told him that if they insisted on examining
him, he would be bound to answer all the
questions which they put to him, honestly and
truly, whatever his private feelings might be.</p>

<p>When the day arrived, Rodolphus was taken
by the officer to the court room, and placed in
the same chair where Antonio had sat. Antonio
had looked around upon the proceedings with so
frank and honest an expression of countenance,
and with such an unconcerned air, that every one
had been impressed with a belief of his innocence.
Rodolphus, on the other hand, sat still, pale, and
trembling, and he manifested in his whole air and
demeanor every indication of conscious guilt.</p>

<p>The preliminary proceedings were all much
the same as they had been in the case of Antonio.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_733" id="Page_733">[Pg 733]</a></span>
When these had been gone through, the
judge called upon the county attorney to proceed.
After a short opening speech he said, that
his first witness was Mr. Kerber. Mr. Kerber
was called, and took his place upon the stand.</p>

<p>Mr. Kerber first gave an account of the robbery,
describing the situation of his office and of
the two doors leading to it, and of the desk in
the corner, and narrating all the circumstances
relating to the appearance of his office on the
Monday morning, and the discovery of the strong
box under the ruins of the corn-barn. He then
proceeded as follows:</p>

<p>"For a time I considered it certain that Antonio,
the one who was first suspected, was the
one really guilty, and made no effort or inquiry
in any other direction until he was tried. I was
convinced then that he was innocent, and immediately
began to consider what I should do to find
out the robber. I examined the hole again which
had been bored into the door, and the marks of
the tools by which the desk had been broken open.
I thought that I might, perhaps, possibly find the
tools that fitted these places somewhere about
town, and that if I should, I might, possibly, in
that way, get some clew to the robbers. So I
borrowed the bits and the chisels of several of my
neighbors, but I could not find any that would fit.</p>

<p>"At last I happened to think of some old tools
that I had in a back room, and on comparing them
I found two that fitted exactly. There was a bit
which just fitted the hole, and there were some
fibres of the wood which had been caught upon
the edge of the bit, where it was dull, that looked
fresh and compared well with the color of the
wood of the door. There was a large chisel, too,
that fitted exactly to the impressions made upon
the wood of the desk, in prying it open.</p>

<p>"I could see, too, that some of these tools had
recently been moved, by the dust having been
disturbed around them. There were marks and
tracks, too, in the dust, upon a bench, where
some boy had evidently climbed up to get the
tools. I tried one of Rodolphus's shoes to these
tracks, and found that it fitted exactly."</p>

<p>While Mr. Kerber was making these statements,
Rodolphus hung his head, and looked utterly
confounded.</p>

<p>"Just about the time," continued Mr. Kerber,
"that I made these discoveries, a person came to
me and informed me&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Stop," interrupted Mr. Keep. "You are not
to state what any other person informed you.
You are only to state what you know personally,
yourself."</p>

<p>Mr. Kerber was silent.</p>

<p>The county attorney, who knew well that this
was the rule in all trials, said that he had nothing
more to ask that witness then, but that he would
withdraw him for a time. He then called Antonio.
Antonio took his place upon the stand.</p>

<p>After the oath was administered as usual, the
county attorney began to question Antonio as
follows:</p>

<p>"Were you in Hiburgh on the night of this
robbery?"</p>

<p>"I was," said Antonio.</p>

<p>"At what time did you arrive there?" asked
the attorney.</p>

<p>"I believe it was a little past nine," said Antonio.</p>

<p>"Were you at the corn-barn when it took
fire?"</p>

<p>"I was," said Antonio.</p>

<p>"State now to the jury what it was that led
you to go there."</p>

<p>Antonio recollected that what first attracted
his attention and led him to go out, was seeing
Rodolphus and the other boys going by with their
lantern, and hearing their suppressed voices; and
he perceived that if he went any further in his testimony
he should prove Rodolphus to be guilty;
so he stopped, and after a moment's pause, he
turned to the judge, and asked whether he could
not be excused from giving any more testimony.</p>

<p>"On what ground do you wish to be excused?"
said the judge.</p>

<p>"Why, what I should say," said Antonio,
"might go against the boy, and I don't wish to
say any thing against him."</p>

<p>"You can not be excused," said the judge,
shaking his head. "It is very often painful to give
testimony against persons accused of crime, but
it is a duty which must be performed."</p>

<p>"But there is a special reason," said Antonio,
"in this case."</p>

<p>"What is the reason?" said the judge.</p>

<p>Antonio hesitated. At length he said timidly,</p>

<p>"His sister saved my life."</p>

<p>Here there was a pause. The preferring such
a request, to be excused from testifying, and for
such a reason, is a very uncommon occurrence in
a court. The judge, the jury, the lawyers, and
all the spectators looked at Antonio, who stood
upon the witness's stand all the time, turning his
face toward the judge, awaiting his decision.</p>

<p>After a pause the judge said,</p>

<p>"Your unwillingness to do any thing to injure
the brother of a girl who saved your life, does you
honor, and I would gladly excuse you if I could,
but it is not in my power. The ends of justice
require that you should give your testimony,
whatever the consequences may be."</p>

<p>"What would be done," asked Antonio, "if I
should refuse to do so?"</p>

<p>"Then you would be sent to prison yourself,"
said the judge, "for contempt of court."</p>

<p>"And suppose I am willing to go to prison,"
said Antonio, "rather than testify against Ellen's
brother; can I do so?"</p>

<p>The judge looked a little perplexed. What
answer he would have given to this question we
do not know, for he was prevented from answering
it, by the county attorney, who here rose and
said,</p>

<p>"May it please your honor, I will withdraw
this witness for the present. I shall be glad to
get along without his testimony, if possible, and
perhaps I can."</p>

<p>Antonio then left the stand, very much relieved.
Rodolphus wondered who would be
called next. His heart sank within him, when<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_734" id="Page_734">[Pg 734]</a></span>
he saw an officer who had gone out a moment
before, come in and lead <i>Gilpin</i> to the witness-stand.</p>

<p>It is customary in almost all countries, whenever
a crime is committed, and it is not possible
to ascertain who committed it by any ordinary
proofs, to allow any one of the accomplices who
is disposed to do so, to come forward and inform
against the rest, and then to exempt him from
punishment in consideration of his so doing. It
seems very base for one person to lead another
into sin, or even to join him in it, and then to
assist in bringing his accomplice to punishment,
in order to escape it himself. But they who combine
to commit crimes, must be expected to be
base. Gilpin was so. There seemed to be nothing
noble or generous in his nature. As soon
as he found out that Rodolphus was suspected,
he feared that Rodolphus would confess, and then
that he should himself be seized. Accordingly,
he went immediately to Mr. Kerber, and told him
that he knew all about the robbery, and that he
would tell all about it, if they would agree that
he should not come to any harm.</p>

<p>This arrangement was finally made. They,
however, seized Gilpin, and shut him up, so as
to secure him for a witness, and he had been in
prison ever since Rodolphus's arrest, though Rodolphus
knew nothing about it. Christopher had
run away the moment he heard of Rodolphus's
arrest, and nothing had since been heard of him.
Gilpin was now brought forward to give his testimony.</p>

<p>There was a great contrast in his appearance,
as he came upon the stand, from that of Antonio.
He looked guilty and ashamed, and he did not
dare to turn his eyes toward Rodolphus at all.
He could not go forward himself and tell a connected
story, but he made all his statements in
answer to questions put to him by the county
attorney. He, however, in the end, told all. He
explained how Rodolphus had first cut a hole in
the partition, and then he narrated the conversation
which the boys had held together behind the
wall. He told about the tools, and the dark lantern,
and the breaking in; also about going to
the corn-barn, burying the box, and then of the
accidental setting of the straw on fire, and of Antonio's
suddenly coming in among them. In a
word, the whole affair was brought completely to
light. Mr. Keep questioned Gilpin afterward
very closely, to see if he would contradict himself,
and so prove that the story which he was
telling, was not true; but he did not contradict
himself, and finally he went away.</p>

<p>There were no witnesses to be offered in favor
of Rodolphus, and very little to be said in his defense.
When, at length, the trial was concluded,
the jury conferred together a little in their seats,
and then brought in a verdict of guilty.</p>

<p>The next day Rodolphus was sentenced to ten
days' solitary confinement in the jail, and after
that, to one year of hard labor in the state prison.</p>

<h4>V. THE FLIGHT.</h4>

<p>Two or three days after Rodolphus's trial, Ellen,
who had done every thing she could to cheer
and comfort her mother in her sorrow, told her
one morning that she desired to go and see her
uncle Randon that day.</p>

<p>"Is it about Rodolphus?" asked her mother.</p>

<p>"Yes, mother," said Ellen.</p>

<p>"Well, you may go," said her mother; "but I
don't think that any thing will do any good now."</p>

<p>After all her morning duties had been performed,
about the house, Ellen put on her bonnet,
and taking Annie by the hand, in order that she
might lead her to school, she set out on the way
to her uncle's. She left Annie at school as she
passed through the village, and she arrived at
her uncle's about ten o'clock.</p>

<p>Her uncle had been married again. His present
wife was a very strong and healthy woman,
who was almost all the time busily engaged about
the farm work, but she was very fond of Ellen,
and always glad to see her at the farm. When
Ellen arrived at the farm, on this occasion, she
went in at the porch door as usual. There was no
one in the great room. She passed through into
the back entry. From the back entry she went
into the back room&mdash;the room where in old times
she used to shut up her kitten.</p>

<p>This room was now used as a dairy. There
was a long row of milk-pans in it, upon a bench.
Mrs. Randon was there. She seemed very glad
to see Ellen, and asked her to walk into the
house.</p>

<p>Ellen said that she came to see her uncle. So
her aunt went with her out into the yard where
her uncle was at work; he was mending a harrow.</p>

<p>"Well, Ellen," said her uncle, "I am very glad
to see you. But I am sorry to hear about poor
Rodolphus."</p>

<p>"Yes," said Ellen, "but I have thought of
one more plan. It's of no use to keep him from
going to the state prison, even if we could, unless
we can get a good place for him. Now
what I wish is, that if we can get him free, you
would let him come and live here with you.
Perhaps you could make him a good boy."</p>

<p>Mr. Randon leaned upon the handle of his
broad ax, and seemed to be at a loss what to say.
He looked toward his wife.</p>

<p>"Yes," said she, "let him come. I should
like to have him come very much. <i>We</i> can make
him a good boy."</p>

<p>"Well," said Mr. Randon.</p>

<p>"Well!" said Ellen. Her eyes brightened up
as she said this, and she turned to go away.
Mr. and Mrs. Randon attempted to stop her, but
she said that she could not stay then, and so she
went away.</p>

<p>"She can not <i>get</i> him free," said Mr. Randon.</p>

<p>"I don't know," said his wife. "Perhaps she
may. Such a girl as she can do a great deal
when she tries."</p>

<p>Ellen went then as fast as she could go, to
Mrs Henry's. She found Antonio in the garden.</p>

<p>"Antonio," said she, "my uncle Randon says
that he will take Rodolphus and let him live
there with him, on the farm, if we can only get
him out of prison."</p>

<p>"But we can't get him out of prison," said<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_735" id="Page_735">[Pg 735]</a></span>
Antonio. "It is too late now, he has been condemned
and sentenced."</p>

<p>"But the governor can pardon him," said Ellen.</p>

<p>"Can he?" said Antonio.</p>

<p>"Yes," said Ellen.</p>

<p>"Can he?" repeated Antonio. "Then I'll go
and see if he <i>will</i>."</p>

<p>Two days after this Antonio was on his way
to the town where the governor lived. He met
with various adventures on his way, and he felt
great solicitude and doubt about the result of the
journey. At last he arrived at the place.</p>

<p>He was directed to a large and handsome
house, which stood in the centre of the principal
street of the village, enveloped in trees and shrubbery.
There was a beautiful yard, with a great
gate leading to it, on one side of the house.</p>

<p>Antonio looked up this yard and saw an elderly
gentleman there, just getting into a chaise. A
person who seemed to be his hired man was holding
the horse. The gentlemen stopped, with
his foot upon the step of the chaise, when he saw
Antonio coming, and looked toward him.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 502px;">
<img src="images/ill-1852-may_illo_09.jpg" width="502" height="444" alt="THE GOVERNOR." />
<span class="caption">THE GOVERNOR.</span>
</div>

<p>"Is this Governor Dummer?" said Antonio,
as he came up.</p>

<p>"Yes," said the gentleman, "that is what
they call me."</p>

<p>"I wanted to see you about some business,"
said Antonio, "but you are going away."</p>

<p>The governor looked at Antonio a moment,
and, being pleased with his appearance, he said,</p>

<p>"Yes, I am going away, but not far. Get
into the chaise with me, and we can talk as we
ride."</p>

<p>So the governor got into the chaise.</p>

<p>Antonio followed him; the hired man let go
of the horse's head, and Antonio and the governor
rode together out of the yard.</p>

<p>Antonio was quite afraid at first, to find himself
suddenly shut up so closely with a governor.
He, however, soon recovered his self-possession,
and began to give an account of Rodolphus'
case. The governor listened very attentively to
all he had to say. Then he asked Antonio a
great many questions, some about Rodolphus'
mother and sister, and also about Antonio himself.
Finally he asked what it was proposed to
do with Rodolphus, in case he should be pardoned
and set at liberty. Antonio said that he was
to go to his uncle's, which was an excellent
place, and where he hoped that he would learn
to be a good boy.</p>

<p>The governor seemed very much interested
in the whole story. He, however, said that he
could not, at that time, come to any conclusion
in respect to the affair; he must make some
further inquiries. He must see the record of the
trial, and the other documentary evidence connected
with the case. He would attend to it
immediately, he said, and write to Mr. Keep in
respect to the result.</p>

<p>About a week after this, Mr. Keep sent for
Antonio to come and see him. Antonio went.</p>

<p>"Well, Antonio," said Mr. Keep, as Antonio
entered his office, "Rodolphus is pardoned. I
I should like to have you ask Mrs. Henry if she
will let you go to-morrow, and bring
him home. If she says that you may
go, call here on your way, and I will
give you some money to pay the expenses
of the journey."</p>

<p>Early the next morning, Antonio
called at Mr. Keep's office, on his
way after Rodolphus. Mr. Keep
gave him some money. Antonio received
it, for he thought it would
not be proper to decline it. He had,
however, plenty of his own. He
had already put in his pocket six half
dollars which he had taken from his
chest that morning. Mr. Keep gave
him a bank bill. He put this bill
into his waistcoat pocket and pinned
it in.</p>

<p>He then proceeded on his journey.
In due time he arrived at the place
where Rodolphus was imprisoned.
The pardon had already arrived, and
the jailer was ready to deliver up Rodolphus
to his friends. He told Antonio that he
was very glad that he had come to take the
boy away. He did not like, he said, to lock up
children.</p>

<p>Antonio took Rodolphus in his wagon, and
they drove away. It was late in the afternoon
when they set out, but though Antonio did not
expect to get to Franconia that night, he was
anxious to proceed as far as he could. He intended
to stop that night at a tavern in a large
town, and get home, if possible, the next day.
They arrived at the tavern safely. They took
supper; and after supper, being tired, they went
to bed. Antonio had done all that he could to
make Rodolphus feel at his ease and happy,
during the day, having said nothing at all to him
about his bad conduct. He had talked to him
about his uncle, and about his going there to live,
and other pleasant subjects. Still Rodolphus<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_736" id="Page_736">[Pg 736]</a></span>
seemed silent and sober, and after supper he
seemed glad to go to bed.</p>

<p>The two boys slept in two rooms which opened
into each other. Antonio proposed to have the
door open, between these rooms, but Rodolphus
seemed to wish to have it shut. Antonio made
no objection to this, but at last, when he was
ready to go to bed, he opened the door a little to
say good-night to Rodolphus. Rodolphus, he
saw, when he opened the door, was sitting at a
little table, writing upon a piece of paper, with
a pencil. Antonio bade him good-night and shut
the door again.</p>

<p>"I hope he is writing to his mother," said
Antonio to himself, "to confess his faults and
promise to be a good boy."</p>

<p>The next morning Antonio rose pretty early,
but he moved softly about the room, so as not to
disturb Rodolphus, who he supposed was asleep,
as his room was still. Antonio went down and
ordered breakfast, and attended to his horses,
and by-and-by he came up again to see if Rodolphus
had got up. He listened at the door,
and all was still. He then opened the door
gently and looked in. There was nobody there,
and to Antonio's great surprise, the bed was
smooth and full, as if had not been disturbed.</p>

<p>Antonio went in. He saw a paper lying on
the table with his own name on the outside of it.
He took this paper up, and found that it was in
Rodolphus's handwriting. It was half in written,
and half in printed characters, and very badly
spelled. The substance of it was this.</p>

<h2>NAPOLEON BONAPARTE.<br />

<small>BY JOHN S.C. ABBOTT.</small></h2>

<h3>THE CONSULAR THRONE.</h3>


<p>France had tried republicanism, and the
experiment had failed. There was neither
intelligence nor virtue among the people, sufficient
to enable them to govern themselves.
During long ages of oppression they had sunk
into an abyss, from whence they could not rise,
in a day, to the dignity of freemen. Not one in
thirty of the population of France could either
read or write. Religion and all its restraints,
were scouted as fanaticism. Few had any idea
of the sacredness of a vote, of the duty of the
minority good-naturedly to yield to the majority.
It is this sentiment which is the political salvation
of the United States. Not unfrequently,
when hundreds of thousands of ballots have been
cast, has a governor of a State been chosen by the
majority of a single vote. And the minority, in
such circumstances, have yielded just as cordially
as they would have done to a majority of tens of
thousands. After our most exciting presidential
elections, the announcement of the result is the
harbinger of immediate peace and good-natured
acquiescence all over the land. The defeated
voter politely congratulates his opponent upon
his success. The French seemed to have attained
no conception of the sanctity of the decisions
of the ballot-box. Government was but a
series of revolutions. Physical power alone was
recognized. The strongest grasped the helm,
and, with the guillotine, confiscation, and exile,
endeavored hopelessly to cripple their adversaries.
Ten years of such anarchy had wearied
the nation. It was in vain to protract the experiment.
France longed for repose. Napoleon
was the only one capable of giving her repose.
The nation called upon him, in the loudest tones
which could be uttered, to assume the reins of
government, and to restore the dominion of security
and order. We can hardly call that man
an usurper who does but assume the post which
the nation with unanimity entreats him to take.
We may say that he was ambitious, that he loved
power, that glory was his idol. But if his ambition
led him to exalt his country; if the power
he loved was the power of elevating the multitude
to intelligence, to self-respect, and to comfort;
if the glory he sought was the glory of
being the most illustrious benefactor earth has
ever known, let us not catalogue his name with
the sensualists and the despots, who have reared
thrones of self-aggrandizement and self-indulgence
upon the degradation of the people. We
must compare Napoleon with the leaders of
armies, the founders of dynasties, and with those
who, in the midst of popular commotions, have
ascended thrones. When we institute such a
comparison, Napoleon stands without a rival,
always excepting, in moral worth, our own
Washington.</p>

<p>The next morning after the overthrow of the
Directory, the three consuls, Napoleon, Sieyes,
and Ducos, met in the palace of the Luxembourg.
Sieyes was a veteran diplomatist, whose gray
hairs entitled him, as he supposed, to the moral
supremacy over his colleagues. He thought that
Napoleon would be satisfied with the command
of the armies, while he would be left to manage
the affairs of state. There was one arm-chair
in the room. Napoleon very coolly assumed it.
Sieyes, much annoyed, rather petulantly exclaimed,
"Gentlemen, who shall take the chair?"
"Bonaparte surely," said Ducos; "he already
has it. He is the only man who can save us."
"Very well, gentlemen," said Napoleon, promptly,
"let us proceed to business." Sieyes was
staggered. But resistance to a will so imperious,
and an arm so strong, was useless.

<span class="caption">THE CONSULS AND THE GOLD.</span>
</div>

<p>Sieyes loved gold. Napoleon loved only glory.
"Do you see," inquired Sieyes, pointing to a
sort of cabinet in the room, "that pretty piece
of furniture?" Napoleon, whose poetic sensibilities
were easily aroused, looked at it with interest,
fancying it to be some relic of the disenthroned
monarchs of France. Sieyes continued:
"I will reveal to you a little secret. We Directors,
reflecting that we might go out of office in
poverty, which would be a very unbecoming
thing, laid aside, from the treasury, a sum to
meet that exigence. There are nearly two hundred
thousand dollars in that chest. As there
are no more Directors, the money belongs to us."
Napoleon now began to understand matters. It
was not difficult for one who had proudly rejected
millions, to look with contempt upon thousands.
"Gentlemen," said he, very coolly,
"should this transaction come to my knowledge,
I shall insist that the whole sum be refunded
to the public treasury. But should I not
hear of it, and I know nothing of it as yet, you,
being two old Directors, can divide the money
between you. But you must make haste. Tomorrow
it may be too late." They took the hint,
and divided the spoil; Sieyes taking the lion's
share. Ducos complained to Napoleon of the
extortion of his colleague. "Settle the business
between yourselves," said Napoleon, "and be
quiet. Should the matter come to my ears, you
will inevitably lose the whole."</p>

<p>This transaction, of course, gave Napoleon a
supremacy which neither of his colleagues could
ever again question. The law which decreed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_738" id="Page_738">[Pg 738]</a></span>
the provisional consulship, conferred upon them
the power, in connection with the two legislative
bodies, of twenty-five members each, of preparing
a new Constitution to be submitted to the
people. The genius of Napoleon, his energy,
his boundless information, and his instinctive insight
into the complexities of all subjects were so
conspicuous in this first interview, that his colleagues
were overwhelmed. That evening Sieyes
went to sup with some stern republicans, his intimate
friends. "Gentlemen," said he, "the
republic is no more. It died to-day. I have this
day conversed with a man who is not only a
great general, but who is himself capable of
every thing, and who knows every thing. He
wants no counselors, no assistance. Politics,
laws, the art of governing, are as familiar to
him as the manner of commanding an army. He
is young and determined. The republic is finished."
"But," one replied, "if he becomes a
tyrant, we must call to our aid the dagger of
Brutus." "Alas! my friends," Sieyes rejoined,
"we should then fall into the hands of the Bourbons,
which would be still worse."</p>

<p>Napoleon now devoted himself, with Herculean
energies, to the re-organization of the government,
and to the general administration of the
affairs of the empire. He worked day and night.
He appeared insensible to exhaustion or weariness.
Every subject was apparently alike familiar
to his mind; banking, police regulations,
diplomacy, the army, the navy, every thing which
could pertain to the welfare of France was,
grasped by his all-comprehensive intellect.</p>

<p>The Directory had tyrannically seized, as hostages,
any relatives of the emigrants upon whom
they could lay their hands. Wives, mothers,
sisters, brothers, fathers, children, were imprisoned
and held responsible, with their lives, for the
conduct of their emigrant relatives. Napoleon
immediately abolished this iniquitous edict, and
released the prisoners. Couriers, without delay,
were dispatched all over France to throw
open the prison doors to these unfortunate captives.</p>

<p>Napoleon even went himself to the Temple,
where many of these innocent victims were
imprisoned, that he might, with his own hand
break their fetters. On Napoleon's return from
this visit to the prison he exclaimed, "What
fools these Directors were! To what a state
have they brought our public institutions. The
prisoners are in a shocking condition. I questioned
them, as well as the jailers, for nothing is
to be learned from the superiors. When in the
prison I could not help thinking of the unfortunate
Louis XVI. He was an excellent man,
but too amiable to deal with mankind. And
Sir Sydney Smith, I made them show me his
apartments. If he had not escaped I should
have taken Acre. There are too many painful
associations connected with that prison. I
shall have it pulled down one day or other. I
ordered the jailer's books to be brought, and finding
the list of the hostages, immediately liberated
them. I told them that an unjust law had
placed them under restraint, and that it was my
first duty to restore them to liberty."</p>

</div>

<p>The priests had been mercilessly persecuted.
They could only escape imprisonment by taking
an oath which many considered hostile to their
religious vows. Large numbers of them were
immured in dungeons. Others, in dismay and
poverty, had fled, and were wandering fugitives
in other lands. Napoleon redressed their wrongs,
and spread over them the shield of his powerful
protection. The captives were liberated, and the
exiles invited to return. The principle was
immediately established that the rights of conscience
were to be respected. By this one act,
twenty thousand grief-stricken exiles were restored
to France, proclaiming through city and
village the clemency of the First Consul. In the
rural districts of France, where the sentiment of
veneration for Christianity still lingered, the
priests were received with the warmest welcome.
And in the hut of the peasant the name of Napoleon
was breathed with prayers and tears of
gratitude.</p>

<p>Some French emigrants, furnished with arms
by England, were returning to France, to join the
royalists in La Vendee, in extending the ravages
of civil war. The ship was wrecked on the
coast of Calais, and they were all made prisoners.
As they were taken with arms in their hands, to
fight against their country, rigorous laws doomed
them, as traitors, to the guillotine. Napoleon interposed
to save them. Magnanimously he asserted&mdash;"No
matter what their intentions were.
They were driven on our soil by the tempest.
They are shipwrecked men. As such they are
entitled to the laws of hospitality. Their persons
must be held inviolable." Unharmed they
were all permitted to re-embark and leave France.
Among these emigrants were many men of illustrious
name. These acts of generosity on the
part of Napoleon did much to disarm their hostility,
and many of them became subsequently
firm supporters of his power.</p>

<p>The Revolutionary tribunals had closed the
churches, and prohibited the observance of the
Sabbath. To efface, if possible, all traces of that
sacred day, they had appointed every tenth day,
for cessation from labor and festivity. A heavy
fine was inflicted upon any one who should close
his shop on the Sabbath, or manifest any reverence
for the discarded institution. Napoleon,
who had already resolved to reinstate Christianity
in paganized France, but who found it necessary
to move with the utmost caution, ordered
that no man should be molested for his religious
principles or practices. This step excited hostility.
Paris was filled with unbelief. Generals,
statesmen, philosophers, scouted the idea
of religion. They remonstrated. Napoleon was
firm. The mass of the common people were
with him, and he triumphed over aristocratic
infidelity.</p>

<p>With singular tact he selected the most skillful
and efficient men to fill all the infinitely varied
departments of state. "I want more head," said
he, "and less tongue." Every one was kept<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_739" id="Page_739">[Pg 739]</a></span>
busy. Every one was under the constant vigilance
of his eagle eye. He appeared to have an
instinctive acquaintance with every branch of
legislation, and with the whole science of government.
Three times a week the minister of
finance appeared before him, and past corruption
was dragged to light and abolished. The
treasury was bankrupt. Napoleon immediately
replenished it. The army was starving, and almost
in a state of mutiny. Napoleon addressed
to them a few of his glowing words of encouragement
and sympathy, and the emaciate soldiers
in their rags, enthusiastically rallied again around
their colors, and in a few days, from all parts of
France, baggage wagons were trundling toward
them, laden with clothing and provisions. The
navy was dilapidated and blockaded. At the
voice of Napoleon in every port of France the
sound of the ship hammer was heard, and a
large armament was prepared to convey succor
to his comrades in Egypt. Such vigor mortal
man never exhibited before. All France felt an
immediate impulse. At the same time in which
Napoleon was accomplishing all these duties,
and innumerable others, any one of which would
have engrossed the whole energies of any common
man, he was almost daily meeting his colleagues
and the two committees to discuss the
new Constitution.</p>

<p>Sieyes was greatly alarmed at the generosity
of some of Napoleon's acts. "The emigrants,"
said he, "will return in crowds. The royalists
will again raise their heads, and the republicans
will be massacred." His imagination was so excited
with apprehensions of conspiracies and assassinations,
that he once awoke Napoleon at three
o'clock in the morning, to inform him of a fearful
conspiracy, which had just been discovered by
the police. Napoleon quietly listened to his
story, and then, raising his head from his pillow,
inquired, "Have they corrupted our guard?"
"No!" Sieyes replied. "Then go to bed," said
Napoleon, "and let them alone. It will be time
enough to be alarmed, when our six hundred
men are attacked." Napoleon was so powerful,
that he could afford to be generous. His magnanimity
was his most effectual safeguard.</p>

<p>In less than six weeks, the new Constitution
was ready to be presented to the nation for their
acceptance. In the original draft, drawn up by
Sieyes, the supreme power was to be vested in
a Grand Elector, to be chosen for life, to possess
a revenue of one million of dollars, and to reside
in the utmost possible magnificence in the palaces
of Versailles. He was to be a mock king, with
all the pomp and pageantry of royalty, but without
its power. This was the office which Sieyes
hoped would satisfy the ambition of Napoleon.
Napoleon exploded it as with a bomb-shell. "Can
you conceive," he exclaimed, "that a man of
the least talent or honor, would humble himself
to accept an office, the duties of which are merely
to fatten like a pig on so many millions a year?"
The Grand Elector was annihilated. The following
was the Constitution adopted. The sovereign
power was to be invested in Napoleon as
First Consul. Two subordinate consuls, Cambaceres
and Lebrun, were to be his counselors,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_740" id="Page_740">[Pg 740]</a></span>
with deliberative voices only. The Consuls proposed
laws to a body called the Tribunate, who
thoroughly discussed them, and either rejected,
or, if they approved, recommended the law to a
third body, called the Legislature. The Legislature
heard the report in silence, having no deliberative
voice. Three were appointed from the
Tribunate to present the arguments in favor of
the law, and three those against it. Without
further debate, the Legislature, as judges, voted.
The Senate also was a silent body. It received
the law from the Legislature, and approved or
condemned. Here were the forms of an ample
supply of checks and balances. Every act proposed
by Napoleon, must be sanctioned by the
Tribunate, the Legislature, and the Senate before
it could become a law.</p>

<p>"The Constitution," said Sieyes, "is a pyramid
of which the people is the base." Every
male in France 21 years of age, paying a tax,
was a voter. They amounted to about 5,000,000.
In their primary assemblies, they chose 500,000
delegates. These delegates, from their own
number, chose 50,000. These latter, from themselves,
chose 5000. These 5000 were the Notables,
or the eligible to office. From them, thus
elected by the people, all the offices were to be
filled. The Constitution declared Napoleon to
be First Consul for ten years, with an annual
salary of $100,000. Cambaceres and Lebrun
were his associate Consuls, with a salary of
$60,000. These three, with Sieyes and Ducos,
were to choose, from the Notables, the Senate, to
consist of eighty members. They were elected
for life, and received a salary of $5000. The
Senate chose three hundred members, from the
Notables, to compose the Legislature, with a
salary of $2000, and one hundred members to
compose the Tribunate, with an annual salary
of $3000 each.</p>

<p>Such, in brief, was the Constitution under
which Napoleon commenced his reign. Under
a man of ordinary vigor this would have been a
popular and a free government. With Napoleon
it was in effect an unlimited monarchy. The
energy of his mind was so tremendous that he
acquired immediately the control of all these
bodies. The plans he proposed were either so
plainly conducive to the public welfare, or he had
such an extraordinary faculty of convincing Tribunes,
Legislators, and Senators that they were
so, that these bodies almost invariably voted in
perfect accordance with his will. It was Napoleon's
unquestioned aim to aggrandize France.
For the accomplishment of that purpose he was
ready to make any conceivable personal sacrifice.
In that accomplishment was to consist all his
glory. No money could bribe him. No enticements
of sensual indulgence could divert his energies
from that single aim. His capacious intellect
seemed to grasp intuitively every thing
which could affect the welfare of France. He
gathered around him, as agents for the execution
of his plans, the most brilliant intellects of Europe,
and yet they all took the attitude of children
in his presence. With a body which seemed incapable
of fatigue, and a mind whose energies
never were exhausted, he consecrated himself to
the majestic enterprise, by day and by night,
and with an untiring energy which amazed and
bewildered his contemporaries, and which still
excites the wonder of the world. No one thought
of resisting his will. His subordinates sought
only to anticipate his wishes. Hence no machinery
of government, which human ingenuity
could devise, could seriously embarrass the free
scope of his energies. His associates often expressed
themselves as entirely overawed by the
majesty of his intellect. They came from his
presence giving utterance to the most profound
admiration of the justice and the rapidity of his
perceptions. "We are pressed," said they, "into
a very whirlwind of urgency; but it is all for the
good of France."</p>

<p>The Constitution was now presented to the
whole people, for their acceptance or rejection.
A more free and unbiased expression of public
opinion could not possibly have been obtained.
The result is unparalleled in the annals of the
ballot-box. There were 3,011,007 votes cast in
favor of the Constitution, and but 1562 in the
negative. By such unanimity, unprecedented in
the history of the world, was Napoleon elected
First Consul of France. Those who reject the
dogma of the divine right of kings, who believe
in the sacred authority of the voice of the people,
will, in this act, surely recognize the legitimacy
of Napoleon's elevation. A better title to the
supreme power no ruler upon earth could ever
show. With Americans it can not be a serious
question who had the best title to the throne,
Louis Capet, from the accident of birth, or
Napoleon Bonaparte, from the unanimous vote
of the people. Napoleon may have abused the
power which was thus placed in his hands.
Whether he did so or not, the impartial history
of his career will record. But it is singularly
disingenuous to call this an usurpation. It was
a nation's voice. "I did not usurp the crown,"
said Napoleon, proudly and justly. "It was
lying in the mire. I picked it up. The people
placed it on my head." It is not strange that the
French people should have decided as they did.
Where is the man now, in either hemisphere,
who would not have preferred the government
of Napoleon to any other dominion which was
then possible in France?</p>

<p>From the comparatively modest palace of the
Luxembourg, Napoleon and Josephine now removed
to take up their residence in the more
magnificent apartments of the Tuileries. Those
saloons of royalty which had been sacked and
denied by the mob of Paris, were thoroughly repaired.
The red cap of Jacobinism had been
daubed upon the walls of the apartments of state,
and a tri-colored cockade had been painted upon
the military hat of Louis XIV. "Wash those
out," said Napoleon. "I will have no such
abominations." The palace was furnished with
more than its former splendor. Statues of illustrious
men of all lands embellished the vacant
niches. Those gorgeous saloons, where kings<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_741" id="Page_741">[Pg 741]</a></span>
and queens for so many ages had reveled, were
now adorned, with outvying splendor, for the
residence of the people's chosen ruler.</p>

<p>Louis was the king of the nobles, placed by
the nobles upon the throne. He consulted for
their interests. All the avenues of wealth and
honor were open for them alone. The people
were merely slaves, living in ignorance, poverty,
obscurity, that the king and the nobles might
dwell in voluptuousness. Napoleon was the
ruler of the <i>people</i>. He was one of their own
number. He was elevated to power by their
choice. He spread out an unobstructed arena
for the play of their energies. He opened before
them the highways to fame and fortune.
The only aristocracy which he favored was the
aristocracy of intellect and industry. No privileged
classes were tolerated. Every man was
equal in the eye of the law. All appealed to the
same tribunals, and received impartial justice.
The taxes were proportioned to property. The
feudal claims of the landed proprietors were
abolished. And there was no situation in the
state, to which the humblest citizen might not
aspire. They called Napoleon First Consul.
They cared not much what he was called, so
long as he was the supreme ruler of their own
choice. They were proud of having their ruler
more exalted, more magnificent, more powerful
than the kings of the nobles. Hence the secret
of their readiness to acquiesce in any plans
which might minister to the grandeur of their
own Napoleon. His glory was their glory. And
never were they better pleased than when they
saw him eclipse in splendor the proudest sovereigns
upon the surrounding thrones.</p>

<p>One evening Napoleon, with his gray surtout
buttoned up closely around him, went out with
Bourrienne, incognito, and sauntered along the
Rue St. Honor&eacute;, making small purchases in the
shops, and conversing freely with the people
about the First Consul and his acts. "Well,
citizen," said Napoleon, in one of the shops,
"what do they say of Bonaparte?" The shop-keeper
spoke of him in terms of the most enthusiastic
admiration. "Nevertheless," said Napoleon,
"we must watch him. I hope that it will
not be found that we have merely changed one
tyrant for another&mdash;the Directory for Bonaparte."
The shop-keeper was so indignant at this irreverent
intimation, that he showered upon Napoleon
such a volley of abuse, as to compel him to escape
precipitately into the street, greatly amused
and delighted with the adventure.</p>

<p>It was on the morning of the 19th of February,
1800, when all Paris was in commotion to witness
the most gratifying spectacle of the people's
sovereign taking possession of the palace of the
ancient kings. The brilliance of Napoleon's character
and renown had already thrown his colleagues
into the shade. They were powerless.
No one thought of them. Sieyes foresaw this
inevitable result, and, with very commendable
self-respect, refused to accept the office of Second
Consul. A few interviews with Napoleon
had taught him that no one could share power
with a will so lofty and commanding. Napoleon
says, "Sieyes had fallen into a mistake respecting
the nature of these Consuls. He was fearful
of mortification and of having the First Consul
to contend with at every step. This would
have been the case had all the Consuls been
equal. We should then have all been enemies.
But the Constitution having made them subordinate,
there was no room for the struggles of
obstinacy." Indeed there was no room for such
a conflict. Utter powerlessness can not contend
with omnipotence. The subordinate Consuls
could only <i>give advice when Napoleon asked it</i>.
He was not likely to trouble them.</p>

<p>The royal apartments in the Tuileries were
prepared for the First Consul. The more modest
saloons in the Pavilion of Flora were assigned to
the two other Consuls. Cambaceres, however,
was so fully conscious of the real position which
he occupied, that he declined entering the palace
of the kings. He said to his colleague, Lebrun,
"It is an error that we should be lodged
in the Tuileries. It suits neither you nor me.
For my part, I will not go. General Bonaparte
will soon want to lodge there by himself. Then
we shall be suffered to retire. It is better not to
go at all."</p>

<p>The morning of Napoleon's removal to the
Tuileries, he slept later than usual. When
Bourrienne entered his chamber at seven o'clock,
Napoleon was soundly asleep. On awaking he
said, "Well, Bourrienne, we shall at length sleep
at the Tuileries. You are very fortunate; you
are not obliged to make a show of yourself. You
may go in your own way. But as for me, I must
go in a procession. This I dislike. But we must
have a display. It gratifies the people. The
Directory was too simple; it therefore enjoyed
no consideration. With the army, simplicity is
in its place. But in a great city, in a palace, it
is necessary that the chief of a state should draw
attention upon himself by all possible means.
But we must move with caution. Josephine
will see the review from the apartments of Consul
Lebrun."</p>

<p>Napoleon entered a magnificent carriage, seated
between his two colleagues, who appeared
but as his attendants or body-guard. The carriage
was drawn by six beautiful white horses, a
present to Napoleon from the Emperor of Austria,
immediately after the treaty of Campo Formio.
A gorgeous train of officers, accompanied
by six thousand picked troops, in the richest
splendor of military display, composed the cort&egrave;ge.
Twenty thousand soldiers, with all the
concomitants of martial pomp, in double files,
lined the streets through which the procession
was to pass. A throng which could not be numbered,
from the city and from the country, filled
the garden, the streets, the avenues, the balconies,
the house-tops, and ebbed and flowed in
surging billows far back into the Elysian Fields.
They had collected to exult in introducing the
idol of the army and of the nation&mdash;the people's
king&mdash;into the palace from which they had expelled
the ancient monarchs of France. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_742" id="Page_742">[Pg 742]</a></span>
moment the state carriage appeared, the heavens
seemed rent with the unanimous shout, "Long
live the First Consul." As soon as Napoleon
arrived at the foot of the great stair, ascending
to the palace, he left the other Consuls, and,
mounting his horse, passed in review the magnificent
array of troops drawn up before him.
Murat was on his right; Lannes on his left.
He was surrounded by a brilliant staff of war-worn
veterans, whose scarred and sun-burnt
visages told of many a toilsome and bloody campaign.
There were three brigades, which appeared
with the banners which had passed
through the terrific conflicts of Lodi, Rivoli, and
Arcola. They were black with powder, and torn
into shreds by shot. Napoleon instantly uncovered
his head, and, with profound reverence,
saluted these monuments of military valor. An
universal burst of enthusiasm greeted the well-timed
and graceful act. Napoleon then returned
to the Tuileries, ascended to the audience-chamber,
and took his station in the centre of the
room. All eyes were fixed upon him. The two
associate Consuls were entirely forgotten, or,
rather, they were reduced to the rank of pages,
following in his train, and gracing his triumph.</p>

<span class="caption">NAPOLEON'S ENTRANCE INTO THE TUILERIES.</span>
</div>

<p>The suite of rooms appropriated to Josephine,
consisted of two magnificent saloons, with private
apartments adjoining. In the evening a vast assemblage
of brilliant guests were gathered in those
regal halls. When Josephine entered the gorgeously
illumined apartments, leaning upon the
arm of Talleyrand, and dressed with that admirable
taste which she ever displayed, a murmur
of admiration rose from the whole assembly.
The festivities of the evening were protracted
until nearly the dawn of the ensuing morning.
When the guests had all retired, Napoleon, with
his hands folded behind him, paced to and fro
through the spacious halls, apparently absorbed
in profound and melancholy thought; and then,
as if half soliloquizing, said to his secretary,
Bourrienne, "Here we are in the Tuileries. We
must take good care to remain here. Who has
not inhabited this palace? It has been the abode
of robbers; of members of the Convention. There
is your brother's house, from which, eight years
ago, we saw the good Louis XVI. besieged in
the Tuileries and carried off into captivity. But
you need not fear a repetition of that scene. Let
them attempt it with me if they dare."</p>

<p>The next morning Napoleon said to Bourrienne,
"See what it is to have the mind set upon a
thing. It is not two years since we resolved to
take possession of the Tuileries. Do you think
that we have managed affairs badly since that
time. In fact, I am well satisfied. Yesterday's
affair went off well. Do you imagine that all
those people who came to pay their court to me
were sincere? Most certainly they were not.
But the joy of the <i>people</i> was real. The people
know what is right. Besides, consult the great
thermometer of public opinion, the public funds.
On the 17th Brumaire they were at 11&mdash;the
20th, 16&mdash;to-day, 21. In this state of things,
I can allow the Jacobins to chatter. But they
must not talk too loud."</p>

<p>With consummate tact, Napoleon selected the
ablest men of the empire to occupy the most
important departments in the state. Talleyrand,
the wily diplomatist, having received his appointment,
said to Napoleon, "You have confided
to me the administration of foreign affairs.
I will justify your confidence. But I deem it
my duty at once to declare, that I will consult
with you alone. That France may be well governed,
there must be unity of action. The First
Consul must retain the direction of every thing,
the home, foreign, and police departments, and
those of war and the marine. The Second Consul
is an able lawyer. I would advise that he
have the direction of legal affairs. Let the Third<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_743" id="Page_743">[Pg 743]</a></span>
Consul govern the finances. This will occupy
and amuse them. Thus you, having at your
disposal the vital powers of government, will be
enabled to attain the noble object of your aims,
the regeneration of France." Napoleon listened
in silence. Having taken leave of his minister,
he said to his secretary, "Talleyrand has detected
my views. He is a man of excellent sense. He
advises just what I intend to do. They walk
with speed who walk alone." Some one had
objected to the appointment of Talleyrand, saying,
"He is a weathercock." "Be it so," said
Napoleon, "he is the ablest Minister for Foreign
Affairs in our choice. It shall be my care that
he exerts his abilities."</p>

<p>"Carnot," objected another, "is a republican."
"Republican or not," Napoleon replied, "he is
the last Frenchman who will wish to see France
dismembered. Let us avail ourselves of his unrivaled
talents in the war department, while he
is willing to place them at our command."</p>

<p>"Fouch&eacute;," objected one, "is a compound of
falsehood and duplicity." "Fouch&eacute; alone," Napoleon
rejoined, "is able to conduct the ministry
of the police. He alone has a knowledge of all
the factions and intrigues which have been spreading
misery through France. We can not create
men. We must take such as we find. It is
easier to modify, by circumstances, the feelings
and conduct of an able servant than to supply
his place."</p>

<p>M. Abriel, a peer of France, was recommended
as Minister of Justice. "I do not know you,
citizen Abriel," said Napoleon, as he presented
him his diploma of office, "but I am informed
that you are the most upright man in the magistracy.
It is on that account that I have named
you Minister of Justice."</p>

<p>One of Napoleon's first acts was to abolish
the annual festival celebrating the bloody death
of Louis XVI. He declared it to be a barbarous
ceremony, and unworthy of a humane people.
"Louis was a tyrant," said Sieyes. "Nay,
nay," Napoleon promptly replied, "Louis was
no tyrant. Had he been a tyrant, I should this
day have been a captain of engineers, and you,
Monsieur L'Abb&eacute;, would have been saying mass."</p>

<p>The Directory had resorted to the iniquitous
procedure of forced loans to replenish the bankrupt
treasury. Napoleon immediately rejected
the tyrannical system. He assembled seventy
of the most wealthy capitalists of Paris, in his
closet at the Tuileries. Frankly he laid before
them the principles of the new government, and
the claims it had on the confidence of the public.
The appeal was irresistible. The merchants and
bankers, overjoyed at the prospect of just and
stable laws, by acclamation voted an immediate
loan of two millions of dollars. Though this
made provision but for a few days, it was very
timely aid. He then established an equitable
tax upon property, sufficient to meet the exigencies
of the state. The people paid the tax
without a murmur.</p>

<p>Napoleon entertained profound aversion for
the men who had been engaged in the sanguinary
scenes of the revolution, particularly for the
regicides. He always spoke with horror of those
men of blood, whom he called the assassins of
Louis. He deplored the necessity of employing
any of them. Cambaceres was a member of the
Convention which had condemned the king to
the guillotine. Though he voted against the
sentence of death, he had advocated his arrest.
"Remember," said Napoleon one day to Cambaceres,
at the same time playfully pinching his
ear, "that I had nothing to do with that atrocious
business. But your case, my dear Cambaceres,
is clear. If the Bourbons ever return, you must
be hanged." Cambaceres did not enjoy such
pleasantry. His smile was ghastly. Upon
the reorganization of the Supreme Court of
France, Napoleon said to Bourrienne, "I do not
take any decided steps against the regicides.
But I will show what I think of them. Target,
the president of this court, refused to defend
Louis XVI. I will replace him by Tronchet,
who so nobly discharged that perilous duty.
They may say what they choose. My mind is
made up."</p>

<p>The enthusiasm of the army was immediately
revived by the attention which the First Consul
devoted to its interests. He presented beautiful
sabres to those soldiers who had highly distinguished
themselves. One hundred were thus
conferred. A sergeant of grenadiers had obtained
permission to write to the First Consul,
expressing his thanks. Napoleon, with his own
hand, replied, "I have received your letter, my
brave comrade. You had no occasion to remind
me of your gallant behavior. You are the most
courageous grenadier in the army since the death
of the brave Benezeti. You have received one
of the hundred sabres which I have distributed,
and all agree that none deserve it better. I wish
much to see you again. The Minister of War
sends you an order to come to Paris." This letter
was widely circulated in the army, and roused
the enthusiasm of the soldiers to the highest
pitch. The First Consul, the most illustrious
general of France, the great Napoleon, calls a
sergeant of grenadiers "my brave comrade."
This sympathy for the people was ever a prominent
trait in Napoleon's character.</p>

<p>The following anecdote will illustrate his views
upon this subject; or, rather, a part of his views.
All men have varying moods of mind, which seem
to be antagonistic to each other. Napoleon was
conversing with O'Meara respecting the English
naval service.</p>

<p>"During the winter," said O'Meara, "the seamen
are better off at sea than the officers."</p>

<p>"Why so?" inquired Napoleon.</p>

<p>"Because," was the reply, "they have the advantage
of the galley-fire, where they can warm
and dry themselves."</p>

<p>"And why can not the officers do the same?"</p>

<p>"It would not be exactly decorous," O'Meara
replied, "for the officers to mix in that familiar
way with the men."</p>

<p>"Ah, this aristocratic pride!" exclaimed Napoleon
"Why, in my campaigns, I used to go<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_744" id="Page_744">[Pg 744]</a></span>
to the lines in the bivouacs; sit down with the
humblest soldier, and converse freely with him.
You are the most aristocratic nation in the world.
I always prided myself on being the man of the
people. I sprung from the populace myself.
Whenever a man had merit I elevated him, without
asking how many degrees of nobility he had.
To the aristocracy you pay every kind of attention.
Nothing can be too good for them. The
people you treat precisely as if they were slaves.
Can any thing be more horrible than your pressing
of seamen? You send your boats on shore
to seize upon every male that can be found, who,
if they have the misfortune to belong to the populace,
if they can not prove themselves <i>gentlemen</i>,
are hurried on board your ships. And yet you
have the impudence to cry out against the conscription
in France. It wounds your pride, because
it fell <i>upon all ranks</i>. You are shocked
that a gentleman's son should be obliged to defend
his country, just as if he were one of the
common people&mdash;that he should be compelled to
expose his body like a vile plebeian. Yet God
made all men alike. One day the people will
avenge themselves. That conscription, which so
offended your aristocratic pride, was conducted
scrupulously according to the principles of equal
rights. Every native of a country is bound to
defend it. The conscription did not, like your
press-gang, crush a particular class, because they
were poor. It was the most just, because the
most equal, mode of raising troops. It rendered
the French army the best composed in the world."</p>

<p>When a prisoner on board the Northumberland,
in his passage to St. Helena, all the common
sailors, though English, became most enthusiastically
attached to Napoleon. Some one alluded
to this fact. "Yes," said Napoleon, "I believe
that they were my friends. I used to go among
them; speak to them kindly, and ask familiar
questions. My freedom in this respect quite
astonished them, as it was so different from that
which they had been accustomed to receive from
their own officers. You English are great aristocrats.
You keep a wide distance between
yourselves and the people."</p>

<p>It was observed in reply, "On board a man-of-war
it is necessary to keep the seamen at a
great distance, in order to maintain a proper respect
for the officers."</p>

<p>"I do not think," Napoleon rejoined, "that it
is necessary to keep up so much reserve as you
practice. When the officers do not eat or drink,
or make too many freedoms with the seamen, I
see no necessity for any greater distinctions.
Nature formed all men equal. It was always
my custom to go freely among the soldiers and
the common people, to converse with them, ask
them little histories, and speak kindly to them.
This I found to be of the greatest benefit to me.
On the contrary, the generals and officers I kept
at a great distance."</p>

<p>Notwithstanding these protestations of freedom
from aristocratic pride, which were unquestionably
sincere, and in their intended application
strictly true, it is also evident that Napoleon was
by no means insensible to the mysterious fascination
of illustrious rank. It is a sentiment implanted
in the human heart, which never has
been, and never can be eradicated. Just at this
time Murat sought Napoleon's sister Caroline
for his bride. "Murat! Murat!" said Napoleon,
thoughtfully and hesitatingly. "<i>He is the son
of an innkeeper. In the elevated rank to which I
have attained I can not mix my blood with his.</i>"
For a moment he seemed lost in thought, and
then continued, "Besides, there is no hurry. I
shall see by-and-by." A friend of the young
cavalry officer urged the strong attachment of
the two for each other. He also plead Murat's
devotion to Napoleon, his brilliant courage, and
the signal service he had rendered at the battle
of Aboukir. "Yes," Napoleon replied, with animation,
"Murat was superb at Aboukir. Well,
for my part, all things considered, I am satisfied.
Murat suits my sister. And, then, they can not
say that I am aristocratic, that I seek grand alliances.
Had I given my sister to a noble, all
you Jacobins would have cried out for a counter-revolution.
Since that matter is settled we must
hasten the business. We have no time to lose.
If I go to Italy I wish to take Murat with me.
We must strike a decisive blow, there. Come
to-morrow." Notwithstanding Napoleon's vast
power, and the millions which had been at his
disposal, his private purse was still so empty,
that he could present his sister Caroline with but
six thousand dollars as her marriage portion.
Feeling the necessity of making some present in
accordance with his exalted rank, he took a magnificent
diamond necklace, belonging to Josephine,
as the bridal gift. Josephine most gracefully
submitted to this spoliation of her jewelry.</p>

<p>As Napoleon became more familiar with the
heights of power to which he had attained, all these
plebeian scruples vanished. He sought to ally his
family with the proudest thrones of Europe; and,
repelling from his bosom the faithful wife of his
early years, he was proud of commingling his
own blood with that of a daughter of the C&aelig;sars.</p>

<p>In the midst of these events, the news arrived
in France of the death of Washington. Napoleon
immediately issued the following order of the day
to the army:&mdash;"Washington is dead! That
great man fought against tyranny. He established
the liberty of his country. His memory
will be ever dear to the free men of both hemispheres;
and especially to the French soldiers,
who, like him and the American troops, have
fought for liberty and equality. As a mark of
respect, the First Consul orders that, for ten days,
black crape be suspended from all the standards
and banners of the Republic."</p>

<p>In reference to the course he pursued at this
time, Napoleon subsequently remarked, "Only
those who wish to deceive the people, and rule
them for their own personal advantage, would
desire to keep them in ignorance. The more they
are enlightened, the more will they feel convinced
of the utility of laws, and of the necessity of defending
them; and the more steady, happy, and
prosperous will society become. If knowledge<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_745" id="Page_745">[Pg 745]</a></span>
should ever be dangerous to the multitude, it can
can only be when the government, in opposition
to the interests of the people, drives them into an
unnatural situation, or dooms the lower classes
to perish for want. In such a case, knowledge
will inspire them with the spirit to defend themselves.
My code alone, from its simplicity, has
been more beneficial to France than the whole
mass of laws which preceded it. My schools and
my system of mutual instruction, are to elevate
generations yet unborn. Thus, during my reign,
crimes were constantly diminishing. On the contrary,
with our neighbors in England, they have
been increasing to a frightful degree. This alone
is sufficient to enable any one to form a decisive
judgment of the respective governments.<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a></p>

<p>"Look at the United States," he continued,
"where, without any apparent force or effort,
every thing goes on prosperously. Every one is
happy and contented. And this is because the
public wishes and interests are in fact the ruling
power. Place the same government at variance
with the will and interest of its inhabitants, and
you would soon see what disturbance, trouble,
and confusion&mdash;above all, what increase of crime,
would ensue. When I acquired the supreme direction
of affairs, it was wished that I might become
a Washington. Words cost nothing; and
no doubt those who were so ready to express
the wish, did so without any knowledge of times,
places, persons, or things. Had I been in America,
I would willingly have been a Washington.
I should have had little merit in so being. I do
not see how I could reasonably have acted otherwise.
But had Washington been in France, exposed
to discord within and invasion from without,
he could by no possibility have been what
he was in America. Indeed it would have been
folly to have attempted it. It would only have
prolonged the existence of evil. For my part, I
could only have been a <i>crowned Washington</i>. It
was only in a congress of kings, and in the
midst of kings, yielding or subdued, that I could
take my place. Then, and then only, could I
successfully display Washington's moderation,
disinterestedness and wisdom."</p>

<p>"I think," said La Fayette, at the time of the
revolution which placed Louis Phillipe upon the
throne of France, "that the Constitution of the
United States is the best which has ever existed.
But France is not prepared for such a government.
We need a throne surrounded by republican
institutions."</p>

<p>Napoleon was indefatigable in his endeavors to
reorganize in the Tuileries the splendors of a
court. The French people were like children
who needed to be amused, and Napoleon took
good care to provide amusement for them. His
ante-chambers were filled with chamberlains,
pages, and esquires. Servants, in brilliant liveries,
loitered in the halls and on the staircases. Magnificent
entertainments were provided, at which
Josephine presided with surpassing grace and
elegance. Balls, operas, and theatres, began to be
crowded with splendor and fashion, and the gay
Parisians were delighted. Napoleon personally
took no interest whatever in these things. All
his energies were engrossed in the accomplishment
of magnificent enterprises for the elevation
of France. "While they are discussing these
changes," said he, "they will cease to talk nonsense
about my politics, and that is what I want.
Let them amuse themselves. Let them dance.
But let them not thrust their heads into the councils
of government. Commerce will revive under
the increasing expenditure of the capital. I am
not afraid of the Jacobins. I never was so much
applauded as at the last parade. It is ridiculous
to say that nothing is right but what is new. We
have had enough of such novelties. I would
rather have the balls of the opera than the saturnalia
of the Goddess of Reason."<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a></p>

<p>While Napoleon was thus engaged in reconstructing
society in France, organizing the army,
strengthening the navy, and conducting the
diplomacy of Europe, he was maturing and executing
the most magnificent plans of internal
improvements. In early life he had conceived a
passion for architectural grandeur, which had
been strengthened and chastened by his residence
among the time-honored monuments of Italy and
Egypt. With inconceivable activity of mind, he
planned those vast works of utility and of beauty
in Paris, and all over the empire, which will forever
remain the memorials of his well-directed
energies, and which will throw a lustre over his
reign which never can be sullied. He erected the
beautiful quay on the banks of the Seine, in front
of the Tuileries. He swept away the buildings
which deformed the Place Carrousel, and united
the Louvre and the Tuileries, forming a magnificent
square between those splendid edifices. He
commenced the construction of a fourth side for
the great square opposite the picture gallery. It
was a vast and a noble undertaking; but it was
interrupted by those fierce wars, which the allied
kings of Europe waged against him. The Bridge
of Arts was commenced. The convents of the
Feuillans and Capucines, which had been filled
with victims during the revolution, were torn
down, and the magnificent Rue de Rivoli, now
one of the chief ornaments of Paris, was thrown
open. Canals, bridges, turnpike-roads, all over
the empire, were springing into existence. One
single mind inspired the nation.</p>

<p>The most inveterate opponents of Napoleon
are constrained to the admission that it is impossible<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_746" id="Page_746">[Pg 746]</a></span>
to refuse the praise of consummate prudence
and skill to these, and indeed to all the arrangements
he adopted in this great crisis of his history.
"We are creating a new era," said he.
"Of the past we must forget the bad, and remember
only the good."</p>

<p>In one of the largest and most populous provinces
of France, that of La Vendee, many thousand
royalists had collected, and were carrying
on a most desperate civil war. England, with her
ships, was continually sending to them money,
ammunition, and arms, and landing among them
regiments of emigrant troops formed in London.
They had raised an army of sixty thousand men.
All the efforts of the Directory to quell the insurrection
had been unavailing. The most awful
atrocities had disgraced this civil conflict. As
soon as Napoleon was firmly seated in his consular
chair, he sent an invitation for the chiefs
of these royalist forces in La Vendee to visit him
in Paris, assuring them of a safe return. They
all accepted the invitation. Napoleon met them
in his audience-chamber with the utmost kindness
and frankness. He assured them that it was
his only object to rescue France from the ruin
into which it had fallen; to bring peace and happiness
to his distracted country. With that laconic
logic which he had ever at command, he
said, "Are you fighting in self-defense? You
have no longer cause to fight. I will not molest
you. I will protect you in all your rights. Have
you taken arms to revive the reign of the ancient
kings? You see the all but unanimous decision
of the nation. Is it honorable for so decided a
minority to attempt, by force of arms, to dictate
laws to the majority?"</p>

<p>Napoleon's arguments were as influential as
his battalions. They yielded at once, not merely
their swords but their hearts' homage. One alone,
George Cadoudal, a sullen, gigantic savage, who
preferred banditti marauding above the blessings
of peace, refused to yield. Napoleon had a private
interview with him. The guard at the door
were extremely alarmed lest the semi-barbarian
should assassinate the First Consul. Napoleon
appealed to his patriotism, his humanity, but all
in vain. Cadoudal demanded his passports and
left Paris. "Why did I not," he afterward
often said, as he looked at his brawny, hairy,
Samson-like arms, "strangle that man when I
had him in my power?" He went to London,
where he engaged in many conspiracies for the
assassination of Napoleon, and was finally taken
in France, and shot.</p>

<span class="caption">NAPOLEON AND THE VENDEEAN CHIEF.</span>
</div>

<p>Civil war was now at an end, and with most
singular unanimity all France was rejoicing in
the reign of the First Consul. Napoleon loved
not war. He wished to build up, not to tear
down. He desired the glory of being the benefactor
and not the scourge of his fellow-men.
Every conflict in which he had thus far been engaged
was strictly a war of self-defense. The
expedition to Egypt can not be considered an
exception, for that enterprise was undertaken as
the only means of repelling the assaults of the
most determined and powerful enemy France has
ever known. Napoleon was now strong. All
France was united in him. With unobstructed
power he could wield all her resources, and guide
all her armies. Under these circumstances most
signally did he show his love of peace, by adopting
the very characteristic measure of writing
directly to the King of England and to the Emperor
of Austria, proposing reconciliation. It was
noble in the highest degree for him to do so.
Pride would have said, "They commenced the
conflict; they shall be the first to ask for peace."
To the King of England he wrote,</p>

<p>"Called, Sire, by the wishes of the French
nation, to occupy the first magistracy of the Republic,
I judge it well, on entering my office, to
address myself directly to your Majesty. Must<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_747" id="Page_747">[Pg 747]</a></span>
the war, which for the four last years has devastated
the world, be eternal? Are there no means
of coming to an understanding? How can the
two most enlightened nations of Europe, stronger
already and more powerful than their safety
or their independence requires, sacrifice to ideas
of vain-glory the well-being of commerce, internal
prosperity, and the repose of families! How
is it that they do not feel peace to be the first of
necessities as the first of glories? These sentiments
can not be strangers to the heart of your
Majesty, who governs a free people with the sole
aim of rendering it happy.</p>

<p>"Your Majesty will perceive only, in this
overture, the sincerity of my desire to contribute
efficaciously, for a second time, to the general
pacification, by this prompt advance, perfectly confidential
and disembarrassed of those forms, which,
perhaps necessary to disguise the dependence
of weak states, reveal, when adopted by strong
states, only the wish of mutual deception. France
and England by the misuse of their powers, may
yet, for a long period, retard, to the misery of all
nations, their exhaustion. But I venture to say
that the fate of the civilized world is connected
with the termination of a war, which has set the
whole world in flames."</p>

<p>To this magnanimous application for peace,
the King of England did not judge it proper to
return any personal answer. Lord Grenville replied
in a letter full of most bitter recriminations.
And all France was exasperated by the insulting
declaration that if France really desired peace,
"<i>The best and most natural pledge of its reality
and permanence, would be the restoration of that
line of princes which, for so many centuries maintained
the French nation in prosperity at home, and
consideration and respect abroad. Such an event
would at once remove, and will at any time remove
all obstacles in the way of negotiation or peace.</i>"</p>

<p>This was, indeed, an irritating response to
Napoleon's pacific appeal. He, however, with
great dignity and moderation, replied through his
minister, M. Talleyrand, in the following terms:</p>

<p>"So far from having provoked the war, France,
from the commencement of the revolution, solemnly
proclaimed her love of peace, her disinclination
for conquests, and her respect for the independence
of all governments. And it is not
to be doubted, that occupied at that time entirely
with her own internal affairs, she would have
avoided taking any part in those of Europe, and
would have remained faithful to her declarations.</p>

<p>"But from an opposite disposition, as soon as
the French revolution had broken out, almost all
Europe entered into a league for its destruction.
The aggression was real long before it was public.
Internal resistance was excited; the enemies
of the revolution were favorably received,
their extravagant declamations were supported,
the French nation was insulted in the person of
its agents, and England particularly set this example,
by the dismissal of the minister of the Republic.
Finally, France was attacked in her independence,
her honor, and her safety, long before
war was declared.</p>

<p>"It is to these projects of dismemberment, subjection,
and dissolution, that France has a right
to impute the evils which she has suffered, and
those which have afflicted Europe. Assailed on
all sides, the Republic could not but equally extend
the efforts of her defense. And it is only
for the maintenance of her own independence,
that she has called into requisition her own
strength and the courage of her citizens. If in
the midst of the critical circumstances which the
revolution and the war have brought on, France
has not always shown as much moderation as
the nation has shown courage, it must be imputed
to the fatal and persevering animosity with
which the resources of England have been lavished
to accomplish the ruin of France.</p>

<p>"But if the wishes of his Britannic majesty
are in unison with those of the French Republic,
for the re-establishment of peace, why, instead
of attempting apologies for the war, should not
attention be directed to the means of terminating
it. It can not be doubted that his Britannic Majesty
must recognize the right of nations to choose
their form of government, since it is from this
right that he holds his crown. But the First
Consul can not comprehend how, after admitting
this fundamental principle, upon which rests the
existence of political societies, his Majesty could
annex insinuations, which tend to an interference
with the internal affairs of the Republic. Such
interference is no less injurious to the French
nation and its government, than it would be to
England and his Majesty, if an invitation were
held out, in form of a return to that republican
form of government which England adopted about
the middle of the last century, or an exhortation
to recall to the throne that family whom their
birth had placed there, and whom a revolution
had compelled to descend from it."</p>

<p>There was no possibility of parrying these
home thrusts. Lord Grenville consequently entirely
lost his temper. Replying in a note even
more angry and bitter than the first, he declared
that England was fighting for the security of all
governments against French Jacobinism, and
that hostilities would be immediately urged on
anew without any relaxation. Napoleon was not
at all disappointed or disheartened at the result
of this correspondence. He earnestly desired
peace. But he was not afraid of war. Conscious
of the principle, "thrice is he armed who hath
his quarrel just," he was happy in the conviction
that the sympathies of impartial men in all nations
would be with him. He knew that the arrogant
tone assumed by England, would unite
France as one man, in determined and undying
resistance. "The answer," said he, "filled me
with satisfaction. It could not have been more
favorable. England wants war. She shall have
it. Yes! yes! war to the death."</p>

<p>The throne of the King of England, the opulence
of her bishops, and the enormous estates
of her nobles were perhaps dependent upon the
issue of this conflict. The demolition of all exclusive
privileges, and the establishment of perfect
equality of rights among all classes of men<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_748" id="Page_748">[Pg 748]</a></span>
in France, must have shaken the throne, the
aristocracy, and the hierarchy of England, with
earthquake power. The government of England
was mainly in the hands of the king, the bishops,
and the lords. Their all was at stake. In a
temptation so sore, frail human nature must not
be too severely censured. For nearly ten years,
the princes of France had been wandering houseless
fugitives over Europe. The nobles of France,
ejected from their castles, with their estates confiscated,
were beggars in all lands. Bishops
who had been wrapped in ermine, and who had
rolled in chariots of splendor, were glad to warm
their shivering limbs by the fire of the peasant,
and to satiate their hunger with his black bread.
To king, and bishop, and noble, in England,
this was a fearful warning. It seemed to be
necessary for their salvation to prevent all friendly
intercourse between England and France, to
hold up the principles of the French Revolution
to execration, and above all, to excite, if possible,
the detestation of the people of England, against
Napoleon, the child and the champion of popular
rights. Napoleon was the great foe to be feared,
for with his resplendent genius he was enthroning
himself in the hearts of the <i>people</i> of all
lands.</p>

<p>But no impartial man, in either hemisphere,
can question that the <i>right</i> was with Napoleon. It
was not the duty of the thirty millions of France
to ask permission of the fifteen millions of England
to modify their government. The kings
of Europe, led by England, had combined to
force with the bayonet, upon France, a rejected
and an execrated dynasty. The inexperienced
Republic, distracted and impoverished by these
terrific blows, was fast falling to ruin. The people
invested Napoleon with almost dictatorial
powers for their rescue. It was their only hope.
Napoleon, though conscious of strength, in the
name of bleeding humanity, pleaded for peace.
His advances were met with contumely and scorn,
and the trumpet notes of defiant hosts rang from
the Thames to the Danube. The ports of France
were blockaded by England's invincible fleet,
demolishing the feeble navy of the Republic, and
bombarding her cities. An army of three hundred
thousand men pressed upon the frontiers
of France, threatening a triumphant march to her
capital, there to compel, by bayonet and bomb-shell,
the French people to receive a Bourbon for
their king. There was no alternative left to
Napoleon but to defend his country. Most nobly
he did it.</p>

<p>The correspondence with the British government,
which redounds so much to the honor of
Napoleon, vastly multiplied his friends among
the masses of the people in England, and roused
in parliament, a very formidable opposition to the
measures of government. This opposition was
headed by Fox, Sheridan, Lord Erskine, the
Duke of Bedford, and Lord Holland. They did
not adopt the atrocious maxim, "Our country&mdash;right
or wrong," but rather the ennobling principle
"Our country&mdash;when in the wrong, we will
try to put her right." Never, in the history of
the world, has there been a more spirited or a
more eloquent opposition than this question elicited.
Fox, the rival of Pitt, and the profound
admirer of Napoleon, was the most prominent
leader of this opposition. Napoleon, with his
laconic and graphic eloquence, thus describes
the antagonistic English statesmen. "In Fox,
the heart warmed the genius. In Pitt the genius
withered the heart."</p>

<p>"You ask," the opposition exclaimed, "who
was the aggressor? What matters that? You
say it was France. France says it was England.
The party you accuse of being the aggressor is
the first to offer to lay down arms. Shall interminable
war continue merely to settle a question
of history? You say it is useless to treat with
France. Yet you treated with the Directory.
Prussia and Spain have treated with the Republic,
and have found no cause for complaint.
You speak of the crimes of France. And yet
your ally, Naples, commits crimes more atrocious,
without the excuse of popular excitement. You
speak of ambition. But Russia, Prussia, and
Austria, have divided Poland. Austria grasps
the provinces of Italy. You yourself take possession
of India, of part of the Spanish, and of
all the Dutch colonies. Who shall say that one
is more guilty than another in this strife of
avarice. If you ever intend to treat with the
French Republic, there can be no more favorable
moment than the present."</p>

<p>By way of commentary upon the suggestion
that France must re-enthrone the Bourbons, a
letter was published, either real or pretended,
from the heir of the exiled house of Stuart, demanding
from George the Third, the throne of
his ancestors. There was no possible way of
parrying this home thrust. George the Third,
by his own admission, was an usurper, seated
upon the throne of the exiled Stuarts. The opposition
enjoyed exceedingly the confusion produced,
in the enemies' ranks, by this well-directed
shot.</p>

<p>The government replied, "Peace with Republican
France endangers all the monarchies of
Europe. The First Consul is but carrying out,
with tremendous energy, the principles of the
revolution&mdash;the supremacy of the people. Peace
with France is but a cessation of resistance to
wrong. France still retains the sentiments which
characterized the dawn of her revolution. She
was democratic. She is democratic. She declares
war against kings. She continues to seek
their destruction."</p>

<p>There was much force in these declarations.
It is true that Napoleon was not, in the strict
sense of the word, a democrat. He was not in
favor of placing the government in the hands of
the great mass of the people. He made no disguise
of his conviction that in France the people
had neither the intelligence nor the virtue essential
to the support of a wise and stable republic.
Distinctly he avowed that in his judgment the
experiment of a republic had utterly failed, that
France must return to monarchy. The great
mass of the people were also satisfied of this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_749" id="Page_749">[Pg 749]</a></span>
necessity. "The French generally," said Napoleon,
"do not ask for <i>liberty</i>. They only seek
<i>equality</i>."</p>

<p>But France no longer wished for an aristocratic
king, who would confer wealth, splendor,
and power exclusively upon his nobles. The
old feudal throne was still hated with implacable
hatred. France demanded a popular throne; a
king for the people, one who would consult the
interests of the masses, who would throw open
to all alike the avenues of influence and honor
and opulence. Such a monarch was Napoleon.
The people adored him. He is <i>our</i> emperor, they
shouted with enthusiasm. We will make him
greater than all the kings of all the nobles. His
palaces shall be more sumptuous, his retinue more
magnificent, his glory more dazzling; for our
daughters may enter his court as maids of honor,
and our sons may go in and out at the Tuileries,
Versailles, and St. Cloud, the marshals of France.
Lord Grenville was right in saying that Napoleon
was but carrying out the principles of the revolution&mdash;equality
of privileges&mdash;the supremacy of
popular rights. But the despots of Europe were
as hostile to such a king as to a republic.</p>

<p>On the same day in which Napoleon's pacific
letter was sent to the King of England, another,
of the same character, was dispatched to the
Emperor of Austria. It was conceived in the
following terms:</p>

<p>"Having returned to Europe, after an absence
of eighteen months, I find a war kindled between
the French Republic and your Majesty. The
French nation has called me to the occupation
of the First Magistracy. A stranger to every
feeling of vain-glory, the first of my wishes is to
stop the effusion of blood which is about to flow.
Every thing leads me to foresee that, in the next
campaign, numerous armies, ably conducted, will
treble the number of the victims, who have already
fallen since the resumption of hostilities.
The well-known character of your Majesty, leaves
me no doubt as to the secret wishes of your
heart. If those wishes only are listened to, I
perceive the possibility of reconciling the interests
of the two nations.</p>

<p>"In the relations which I have formerly entertained
with your Majesty, you have shown me
some personal regard. I beg you, therefore, to
see in this overture, which I have made to you,
the desire to respond to that regard, and to convince
your Majesty, more and more, of the very
distinguished consideration which I feel toward
you."</p>

<p>Austria replied, in courteous terms, that she
could take no steps in favor of peace without
consulting her ally England. Thus all Napoleon's
efforts to arrest the desolations of war
failed. The result had been anticipated. He
was well aware of the unrelenting hostility with
which the banded kings of Europe contemplated
the overthrow of a feudal throne, and of the
mortal antipathy with which they regarded the
thought of receiving a democratic king into their
aristocratic brotherhood. Nothing now remained
for Napoleon but to prepare to meet his foes.
The allies, conscious of the genius of that great
captain who had filled the world with the renown
of his victories, exerted themselves to the utmost
to raise such forces, and to assail Napoleon with
numbers so overwhelming, and in quarters so
varied as to insure his bewilderment and ruin.
The Archduke Charles, of Austria, who was
practically acquainted with the energy of Napoleon,
urged peace. But England and Austria
were both confident that France, exhausted in
men and money, could not hold out for another
campaign.</p>

<p>The Bourbons now made an attempt to bribe
Napoleon to replace them upon their lost throne.
The Count of Provence, subsequently Louis
XVIII., wrote to him from London, "For a long
time, general, you must have known the esteem
in which I hold you. If you doubt my gratitude,
mark your own place. Point out the situation
you wish for your friends. The victor of Lodi,
Castiglione, and Arcola, can never prefer a vain
celebrity to true glory. But you are losing the
most precious moments. We could secure the
happiness of France. I say we, for I require
Bonaparte for such an attempt, and he could not
achieve it without me. Europe observes you.
Glory awaits you. I am impatient to restore
peace to my people."</p>

<p>Napoleon did not imitate the example of the
King of England and pass this letter over to his
minister. Courteously and kindly, with his own
hand he replied. "I have received your letter.
I thank you for the obliging expressions it contains
respecting myself. You should renounce
all hopes of returning to France. You could not
return but over the corpses of 100,000 Frenchmen.
Sacrifice your interest to the happiness
and repose of your country. History will duly
appreciate your conduct, in so doing. I am not
insensible to the misfortunes of your family, and
shall learn with pleasure that you are surrounded
with every thing which can restore the tranquillity
of your retreat."</p>

<p>Benedict Arnold attempted to bring the American
Revolution to a close by surrendering the
United States to their rejected king. It was
not in Napoleon's line of ambition to imitate
his example. The Bourbons, finding the direct
proffer of reward unavailing, then tried the effect
of female blandishments. The fascinating Duchess
of Guiche, a lady of great beauty and talent,
was dispatched a secret emissary to the court of
the First Consul, to employ all the arts of eloquence,
address, and the most voluptuous loveliness,
in gaining an influence over Napoleon.
Josephine, who had suffered so much during the
Revolution, and whose associations had been
with the aristocracy of France, was a royalist.
She trembled for the safety of her husband, and
was very anxious that he should do whatever in
honor might be done, to restore the Bourbons.
In every possible way she befriended the royalists,
and had secured, all over Europe, their cordial
esteem. The Duchess of Guiche easily got access
to Josephine. Artfully she said, one morning
at the breakfast-table, "A few days ago I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_750" id="Page_750">[Pg 750]</a></span>
was with the Count of Provence in London.
Some one asked him what he intended to do for
Napoleon, in the event of his restoring the Bourbons.
He replied, 'I would immediately make
him Constable of France, and every thing else
which he might choose. And we would raise on
the Carrousel, a magnificent column, surmounted
with a statue of Bonaparte crowning the Bourbons.'"
Soon after breakfast Napoleon entered.
Josephine most eagerly repeated the words to
him. "And did you not reply," said Napoleon,
"that the corpse of the First Consul would be
made the pedestal of the column." The fascinating
duchess was still present. She immediately
assailed Napoleon with all her artillery of
beauty, smiles, and flattery. The voluptuous
freedom of her manners, and the charms of the
bewitching emissary, alarmed the jealousy of
Josephine. Napoleon, however, was impervious
to the assault. That night the duchess received
orders to quit Paris; and in the morning, in the
charge of the police, she was on her way toward
the frontier.</p>

<span class="caption">NAPOLEON AND THE DUCHESS OF GUICHE.</span>
</div>

<p>It has often been said that Napoleon made
overtures to the Bourbons for the cession of their
rights to the throne. In reference to this assertion
Napoleon says, "How was such a thing
possible? I, who could only reign by the very
principle which excluded them, that of the sovereignty
of the people; how could I have sought
to possess, through them, rights which were proscribed
in their persons? That would have been
to proscribe myself. The absurdity would have
been too palpable, too ridiculous. It would have
ruined me forever in public opinion. The fact
is that neither directly nor indirectly, at home
or abroad, did I ever do any thing of the kind."</p>

<p>The report probably originated in the following
facts. Friendly relations were at one time
existing between Prussia and France. The
Prussian government inquired if Napoleon would
take umbrage if the Bourbon princes were allowed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_751" id="Page_751">[Pg 751]</a></span>
to remain in the Prussian territory. Napoleon
replied that he had no objections to that
arrangement. Emboldened by the prompt consent,
it was then asked if the French government
would be willing to furnish them with an annual
allowance for their support. Napoleon replied
that it should be done most cheerfully, provided
Prussia would be responsible for the princes remaining
quiet, and abstaining from all intrigues
to disturb the peace of France.</p>

<p>A few evenings after this last attempt of Louis
XVIII. to regain the throne, Napoleon was one
evening walking with Bourrienne in the gardens
of his favorite retreat at Malmaison. He was in
fine spirits, for all things were moving on very
prosperously.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 444px;">
<img src="images/ill-1852-may_illo_15.jpg" width="444" height="541" alt="NAPOLEON AND BOURRIENNE." />
<span class="caption">NAPOLEON AND BOURRIENNE.</span>
</div>

<p>"Has my wife," said he to Bourrienne, "been
speaking to you of the Bourbons?"</p>

<p>"No, general!" Bourrienne replied.</p>

<p>"But, when you converse with her," Napoleon
added, "you lean a little to her opinions. Tell
me now, why do you desire the return of the
Bourbons? You have no interest in their return;
nothing to expect from them. You can
never be any thing with them. You have no
chance but to remain all your life in an inferior
situation. Have you ever seen a man rise under
kings by merit alone?"</p>

<p>"General," replied Bourrienne, "I am quite
of your opinion on one point. I have never received
any favor under the Bourbons; neither have
I the vanity to suppose I should ever rise, under
them, to any conspicuous station. But I look at
the interests of France. I believe that you will
hold your power as long as you live. But you have
no children, and it is pretty certain that you will
never have any by Josephine. What are we to
do when you are gone? What is to become of
France? You have often said that your brothers
were not&mdash;"</p>

<p>Here Napoleon interrupted him, exclaiming:
"Ah! as to that you are right. If I do not
live thirty years to finish my work, you will, when
I am dead, have long civil wars. My brothers
do not suit France. You will then have a violent
contest among the most distinguished generals,
each of whom will think that he has a right to
take my place."</p>

<p>"Well, general," said Bourrienne, "why do
you not endeavor to remedy those evils which
you foresee?"</p>

<p>"Do you suppose," Napoleon replied, "that
I have never thought of that? But weigh well
the difficulties which are in my way. In
case of a restoration, what is to become
of the men who were conspicuous in the
revolution? What is to become of the
confiscated estates and the national domain,
which have been sold and sold
again? What is to become of all the
changes which have been effected in the
last twelve years?"</p>

<p>"But, general," said Bourrienne, "need
I recall to your attention, that Louis
XVIII. in his letter to you guarantees the
contrary of all which you apprehend?
Are you not in a situation to impose any
conditions you may think fit?"</p>

<p>"Depend upon it," Napoleon replied,
"the Bourbons will think that they have
reconquered their inheritance, and will
dispose of it as they please. Engagements
the most sacred, promises the most
positive, will disappear before force. No
sensible man will trust them. My mind is
made up. Let us say no more upon the
subject. But I know how these women
torment you. Let them mind their knitting,
and leave me to mind my affairs."</p>

<p>Pithily Bourrienne adds, "The women
knitted. I wrote at my desk. Napoleon
made himself Emperor. The empire has
fallen to pieces. Napoleon is dead at St. Helena.
The Bourbons have been restored."</p>

<p>The boundless popularity which Napoleon acquired,
was that which follows great achievements,
not that which is ingloriously sought for
by pampering to the vices and yielding to the
prejudices of the populace. Napoleon was never
a demagogue. His administration was in accordance
with his avowed principles. "A sovereign,"
said he, "must serve his people with dignity, and
not make it his chief study to please them. The
best mode of winning their love is to secure their
welfare. Nothing is more dangerous than for a
sovereign to flatter his subjects. If they do not
afterward obtain every thing which they want,
they become irritated, and fancy that promises
have been broken. If they are then resisted,
their hatred increases in proportion as they consider
themselves deceived. A sovereign's first
duty is unquestionably to conform with the wishes
of his people. But what the people say is scarcely<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_752" id="Page_752">[Pg 752]</a></span>
ever what they wish. Their desires and their
wants can not be learned from their own mouths,
so well as they are to be read in the heart of their
prince."</p>

<p>Again he said in memorable words, which must
not be forgotten in forming a just estimate of his
character, "The system of government must be
adapted to the spirit of the nation. France required
a strong government. France was in the
same state as Rome when a dictator was declared
necessary for the salvation of the republic. Successions
of coalitions against the existence of the
Republic, had been formed by English gold among
all the most powerful nations of Europe. To
resist successfully it was essential that all the
energies of the country should be at the disposal
of the chief. I never conquered unless in my
own defense. Europe never ceased to make war
against France and her principles. It was necessary
for us to conquer, that we might not be conquered.
Between the parties which agitated
France I was like a rider seated on an unruly
horse, who always wants to swerve either to the
right or the left. To lead him to keep a straight
course, he is obliged to make him feel the bridle.
The government of a country, just emerging from
revolution, menaced by foreign enemies and agitated
by the intrigues of domestic traitors, must
necessarily be energetic. In quieter times my
dictatorship would have terminated, and I should
have commenced my constitutional reign. Even,
as it was, with a coalition always existing against
me, either secret or public, there was more equality
in France, than in any other country in Europe.
One of my grand objects was to render
education accessible to every body. I caused
every institution to be formed upon a plan which
offered instruction to the public either gratis, or
at a rate so moderate as not to be beyond the
means of the peasant. The museums were
thrown open to the whole people. The French
populace would have become the best educated
in the world. All my efforts were directed to
illuminate the mass of the nation, instead of
brutifying them by ignorance and superstition.
The English people, who are lovers of liberty,
will one day lament, with tears, having gained
the battle of Waterloo. It was as fatal to the
liberties of Europe as that of Philippi was to
those of Rome. It has precipitated Europe into
the hands of despots, banded together for the oppression
of mankind."</p>

<p>Though Napoleon felt deeply the sanctity of
law, and the necessity of securing the inflexible
enforcement of its penalties, he was never more
highly gratified than when he was enabled, by
the exercise of the pardoning power, to rescue
the condemned. Says Bourrienne, whose testimony
will not be questioned, "When the imperious
necessities of his political situation, to
which, in fact, he sacrificed every thing, did not
interpose, the saving of life afforded him the highest
satisfaction. He would even have thanked
those, to whom he rendered such a service, for
the gratification they had thus afforded him."
A French emigrant, M. Defeu, had been taken,
with arms in his hands, fighting against France.
The crime was treason; the penalty death. He
was connected with some of the most honorable
families in France. A very earnest petition was
presented to Napoleon for his pardon. "There
is no room for mercy here," Napoleon sternly
replied. "A man who fights against his country
is a child who would kill his mother." The
affecting condition of his family was urged, and
the beneficial effects upon the community of such
an act of clemency. Napoleon paused for a moment,
and then said, "Write, 'The First Consul
orders the judgment on M. Defeu to be suspended.'"
The laconic reprieve was instantly written,
signed by Napoleon, and dispatched to Sens,
where the unfortunate man was imprisoned. The
next morning, the moment Bourrienne entered
the First Consul's apartment, Napoleon said to
him, "I do not like to do my work by halves.
Write to Sens, 'The First Consul desires that M.
Defeu be immediately liberated.' He may repay
the deed with ingratitude. But we can not help
that&mdash;so much the worse for him. In all such
cases, Bourrienne, never hesitate to speak to me.
When I refuse it will only be because I can not
do otherwise."</p>

<p>In Napoleon's disposition firmness and gentleness
were singularly and beautifully blended.
The following anecdote illustrates the inflexibility
of his sense of justice. A wealthy nobleman,
thirty years of age, had married a young girl of
sixteen. It was a mercenary marriage. The
friends of the young lady, without any regard
to her feelings, dragged her to the altar. She
cherished no affection for her husband. He became
jealous of her, and, without the slightest
proof of her criminality, murdered her. He was
arrested, tried, and condemned to death. Connected
by birth with the first families in France,
and rallying around him the interest of the most
influential of friends, great exertions were made
to obtain from the First Consul a pardon. To
the petitioners, pleading in his behalf, Napoleon
replied:</p>

<p>"Why should I pardon this man? He availed
himself of his fortune for the vile purpose of
bribing the affections of a girl. He did not succeed
in winning them, and he became jealous.
His jealousy was not the result of love but of
vanity. He has committed the crime of murder.
What urged him to it? Not his honor, for his
wife had not injured it. No! he was instigated
by brutality, vanity, and self-love. He has no
claim to mercy. The rich are too prone to consider
themselves elevated above the reach of the
law. They imagine that wealth is a sacred shield
to them. This man has committed a crime for
which there are no extenuating circumstances.
He must suffer the punishment to which he is
justly doomed. If I were to pardon him, that
act of misplaced indulgence would put in jeopardy
the life of every married woman. As the law
positively protects the outraged husband, so it
must protect the wife against the consequences
of dislike, interest, caprice, or a new passion,
which may impel a husband to obtain a divorce,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_753" id="Page_753">[Pg 753]</a></span>
by a more prompt and less expensive course than
a legal process."</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">
<img src="images/ill-1852-may_illo_16.jpg" width="600" height="354" alt="UNAVAILING INTERCESSION OF JOSEPHINE." />
<span class="caption">UNAVAILING INTERCESSION OF JOSEPHINE.</span>
</div>

<p>Josephine whose tender feelings at times controlled
her judgment was urgent in her intercession.
Many of the relatives of the wretched man
were among her most intimate friends. "This,"
said she, "is the first favor I have asked since
your attainment of the supreme power. Surely
you will not deny me?"</p>

<p>"I can not," said Napoleon, "grant your request.
And when it is known, Josephine, that
even your persuasions could not induce me to
commit an act of injustice, no one else will
henceforth dare to petition me for such a purpose."</p>

<p>England, Austria, and Russia, together with
many other of the minor powers of monarchical
Europe, were now combined against France.
The Emperor Paul of Russia had furnished a
large army to co-operate with the allies in their
assault upon the Republic. Ten thousand of the
Russians had been taken prisoners. But in the
recent disasters which had overwhelmed the arms
of France, many thousand French prisoners were
in the hands of the allies. Napoleon proposed
an exchange. The Austrian government refused,
because it selfishly wished to exchange for Austrians
only. The English government also refused,
assigning the reason that it was contrary
to their principles to exchange for prisoners taken
from other nations. "What," exclaimed Napoleon
to the Court of St. James, "do you refuse
to liberate the Russians, who were your allies,
who were fighting in your ranks, and under your
own commander, the Duke of York?" With
Vienna he also expostulated, in tones of generous
warmth, "Do you refuse to restore to their
country those men to whom you are indebted for
your victories and conquests in Italy, and who
have left in your hands a multitude of French
prisoners, whom they have taken? Such injustice
excites my indignation." Then yielding to
those impulses, so characteristic of his generous
nature, he exclaimed, "I will restore them to the
Czar without exchange. He shall see how I
esteem brave men." Whatever Napoleon undertook
he performed magnificently. The Russian
officers immediately received their swords. The
captive troops, ten thousand in number, were
assembled at Aix-la-Chapelle. They were all
furnished with a complete suit of new clothing
in the uniform of their own regiments, and thoroughly
armed with weapons of the very best of
French manufacture. The officers were authorized
to organize them into battalions and regiments.
And thus triumphantly these battalions of armed
men were returned into the bosom of the ranks
of the multitudinous hosts, rushing down upon
France. It is gratifying to record that magnanimity
so extraordinary passed not away unappreciated.</p>

<p>The Emperor Paul was so disgusted with the
selfishness of Austria and England, and was so
struck with admiration in view of this unparalleled
generosity of Napoleon, that he immediately
abandoned the alliance. He attached himself
to Napoleon with that enthusiasm of constitutional
ardor which characterized the eccentric
monarch. In a letter to the First Consul, written
with his own hand, he said, "Citizen First Consul!&mdash;I
do not write to you to discuss the rights
of men or citizens. Every country governs itself
as it pleases. Wherever I see at the head of a
nation a man who knows how to rule and how
to fight, my heart is attracted toward him. I
write to acquaint you with my dissatisfaction
with England, who violates every article of the
law of nations, and has no guide but her egotism
and her interest. I wish to unite with you to
put an end to the unjust proceedings of that
government."</p>

<p>Russia was thus detached from the alliance,
and sending a minister to Paris, recognized the
new government. Napoleon now sent an embassador
to Prussia to establish, if possible, friendly
relations with that power. Duroc, the only one
whom Napoleon ever admitted to his ultimate
friendship, was selected for this mission, in consequence<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_754" id="Page_754">[Pg 754]</a></span>
of his graceful address, his polished
education, and his varied accomplishments.&mdash;Frederick
William was a great admirer of military
genius. Duroc, who had been in the campaigns
of Italy and of Egypt, could interest him with
the recital of many heroic enterprises. The first
interview of Duroc with the Prussian monarch
was entirely private, and lasted two hours. The
next day Duroc was invited to dine with the
king, and the Prussian court immediately recognized
the consular government.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding Napoleon's vast exaltation,
he preserved personally the same simple tastes
and habits, the same untiring devotion to the
details of business, and the same friendships as
when he was merely a general of the Republic.
He rose at seven o'clock, dressed with scrupulous
neatness, during which time the morning journals
were read to him. He then entered his
cabinet, where he read letters, and wrote or dictated
answers until ten. He then breakfasted
with Josephine and Hortense, usually some of his
aids and one or two literary or scientific friends
being invited. At the close of this frugal meal,
he attended the meetings of the Council, or paid
visits of ceremony or business to some of the
public offices. At five o'clock he returned to dinner,
on ordinary occasions not allowing himself
more than fifteen minutes at the table. He then
retired to the apartments of Josephine, where he
received the visits of ministers, and of the most
distinguished persons of the metropolis.</p>

<p>In the organization of his court Napoleon was
unalterably determined to suppress that licentiousness
of manners, which for ages had disgraced
the palaces of the French monarchs, and
which, since the overthrow of Christianity, had
swept like a flood of pollution over all France.
He was very severe upon those females, often
of the highest rank, who endeavored to attract
attention by freedom of dress or behavior. It
was expected that men and their wives should
appear in society together&mdash;a thing hitherto unprecedented,
and contrary to all ideas of fashionable
life. The court had hitherto taken the lead
in profligacy, and the nation had followed. Napoleon
thought that by enforcing purity of morals
in the palace, he could draw back the nation to
more decorum of manners. "Immorality," said
he, "is, beyond a doubt, the worst of all faults
in a sovereign; because he introduces it as a
fashion among his subjects, by whom it is practiced
for the sake of pleasing him. It strengthens
every vice, blights every virtue, and infects all
society like a pestilence. In short, it is a nation's
scourge."</p>

<p>On one occasion a courtier, very high in rank
and office, one of the imperial chamberlains, requested
permission to present his daughter-in-law
at court. She was extremely beautiful, and
though distinguished by a captivating air of simplicity,
was one of the most artful of the daughters
of Eve. She joined the imperial parties on
all occasions, and wherever she went threw herself
in the way of Napoleon. Her soft and languishing
eyes were riveted upon him. She
sighed, blushed, and affected bashfulness, while,
at the same time, she constantly placed herself
in situations to attract his notice. Sometimes she
would stand, for a long time, apparently lost in
reverie, gazing and sighing before the portraits
of Napoleon. Her father-in-law affected displeasure
at her conduct, and complained of the
unfortunate but resistless passion which she had
imbibed. Her husband, who was infamously in
the intrigue, regarded the matter with the most
philosophic indifference. The mother-in-law also
made herself busy to help the matter along, saying
that, after all, it was hard to blame her for
loving Napoleon. For some time Napoleon paid
no attention to the intrigue, and appeared not to
notice it. At length the affair became a subject
of court gossip, and it was necessary that it
should be noticed.</p>

<p>One evening, at the close of a sitting of the
Council of State, at which Napoleon had presided,
conducting Cambaceres into the recess of
one of the windows, he said, "Madame B&mdash;&mdash; is
rendering herself quite intolerable to me. The
conduct of her relations is still more odious. The
father-in-law is an infamous man, her husband a
mean-spirited wretch, and her mother a vile intriguing
woman, by whose arts, however, I am
not to be duped. The abandoned female, who
unreservedly puts up her virtue to sale, is preferable
to the hypocrite who, for motives equally
mercenary, affects a sentimental attachment. I
wish you to call on my chamberlain, and inform
him that I dispense with his services for the space
of a year. Inform his wife that I forbid her appearance
at court for six years. And make known
to the affectionate married couple, that, to afford
them an opportunity of duly appreciating each
other's excellent qualities, I give them leave to
spend six months in Naples, six months in Vienna,
and six months in any other part of Germany."</p>

<p>On another occasion a lieutenant-colonel sent
a petition to Napoleon, soliciting promotion. In
accordance with the corruptions of those paganized
times, he added, "I have two <i>beautiful
daughters</i>, who will be too happy to throw themselves
at the feet of the good Emperor, and thank
him for the benefit conferred on their father."
Napoleon was indignant at this atrocious proposal.
He said, "I know not what withholds
me from having this infamous letter inserted in
the order of the day of the writer's regiment."
Napoleon made inquiries respecting this officer,
and found that he had been one of the assassins
during the reign of terror, and an intimate friend
of Robespierre. He immediately dismissed him
from service. He found that the daughters were
amiable and interesting young ladies, totally
unconscious of the infamous project entertained
by their father. That they might not suffer the
penalty of their father's baseness, he settled a
small pension on each of them, on condition of
their leaving Paris, and retiring to their native
city.</p>

<p>Napoleon effectually enthroned himself in the
hearts of the common people of France. They believed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_755" id="Page_755">[Pg 755]</a></span>
him to be their friend and advocate. They
still cherish the same belief. At this hour there
is no ruler, enthroned or entombed, who is regarded
with the enthusiastic veneration with
which the people of France now cherish the
memory of their emperor. Napoleon stands
alone in that glory. He has no rival.</p>

<h2>THE BEDOUEEN, MOHAMMAD ALEE, AND THE BAZAARS.<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a></h2>


<h3>AMONG THE BEDOUEEN.</h3>

<p>The pleasant tales of Sultans' pilgrimages are
only the mirage of memory.</p>

<p>The poor and pious Muslim, which is not the
title of Caliphs, when he undertakes a long desert
journey, does not carry nine hundred camels
for his wardrobe, but he carries his grave-linen
with him. Stricken by fatigue, or privation, or
disease, when his companions can not tarry for
his recovery or death, he performs the ablution
with sand, and digging a trench in the ground,
wraps himself in his grave-clothes, and covering
his body with sand, lies alone in the desert to
die, trusting that the wind will complete his
burial.</p>

<p>In the Arabs around you, you will mark a
kindred sobriety. Their eyes are luminous and
lambent, but it is a melancholy light. They do
not laugh. They move with easy dignity, and
their habitual expression is musing and introverted,
as that of men whose minds are stored with
the solemn imagery of the desert.</p>

<p>You will understand that your own party of
Arabs is not of the genuine desert breed. They
are dwellers in cities, not dwellers in tents.
They are mongrel, like the population of a sea-port.
They pass from Palestine to Egypt with
caravans of produce, like coast-traders, and are
not pure Bedoueen. But they do not dishonor
their ancestry. When a true Bedoueen passes
upon his solitary camel, and with a low-spoken
salaam, looks abstractedly and incuriously upon
the procession of great American Moguls, it is
easy to see that his expression is the same as
that of the men around you, but intensified by the
desert.</p>

<p>Burckhardt says that all Orientals, and especially
the Arabs, are little sensible of the beauty
of nature. But the Bedoueen is mild and peaceable.
He seems to you a dreamy savage. There
is a softness and languor, almost an effeminacy
of impression, the seal of the sun's child. He
does not eat flesh&mdash;or rarely. He loves the white
camel with a passion. He fights for defense, or
for necessity; and the children of the Shereefs,
or descendants of the Prophet, are sent into the
desert to be made heroes. They remain there
eight or ten years, rarely visiting their families.</p>

<p>The simple landscape of the desert is the symbol
of the Bedoueen's character; and he has little
knowledge of more than his eye beholds. In
some of the interior provinces of China, there is
no name for the ocean, and when in the time of
Shekh Daheir, a party of Bedoueen came to Acre
upon the sea, they asked what was that desert of
water.</p>

<p>A Bedoueen after a foray upon a caravan, discovered
among his booty several bags of fine
pearls. He thought them dourra, a kind of grain.
But as they did not soften in boiling, he was
about throwing them disdainfully away, when a
Gaza trader offered him a red tarboosh in exchange,
which he delightedly accepted.</p>

<p>Without love of natural scenery, he listens forever
to the fascinating romances of the poets, for
beautiful expressions naturally clothe the simple
and beautiful images he every where beholds. The
palms, the fountains, the gazelles, the stars, and
sun, and moon, the horse, and camel&mdash;these are
the large illustration and suggestion of his poetry.</p>

<p>Sitting around the evening fire and watching
its flickering with moveless melancholy, his heart
thrills at the prowess of El-Gundubah, although
he shall never be a hero, and he rejoices when
Kattalet-esh-Shugan says to Gundubah, "Come
let us marry forthwith," although he shall never
behold her beauty, nor tread the stately palaces.</p>

<p>He loves the moon which shows him the way
over the desert that the sun would not let him
take by day, and the moon looking into his eyes,
sees her own melancholy there. In the pauses
of the story by the fire, while the sympathetic
spirits of the desert sigh in the rustling wind, he
says to his fellow, "Also in all true poems there
should be palm-trees and running water."</p>

<p>For him in the lonely desert the best genius of
Arabia has carefully recorded upon parchment its
romantic visions, for him Haroun El Rashid lived
his romantic life, for him the angel spoke to Mohammad
in the cave, and God received the Prophet
into the seventh heaven.</p>

<p>Some early morning a cry rings through the
group of black square tents. He springs from his
dreams of green gardens and flowing waters, and
stands sternly against the hostile tribe which has
surprised his own. The remorseless morning secretes
in desert silence the clash of swords, the
ring of musketry, the battle-cry. At sunset the
black square tents are gone, the desolation of
silence fills the air that was musical with the recited
loves of Zul-Himmeh, and the light sand
drifts in the evening wind over the corpse of a
Bedoueen.</p>

<p>&mdash;So the grim Genius of the desert touches
every stop of romance and of life in you as you
traverse his realm and meditate his children. Yet
warm and fascinating as is his breath, it does not
warp your loyalty to your native West, and to
the time in which you were born. Springing
from your hard bed upon the desert, and with wild
morning enthusiasm pushing aside the door of
your tent, and stepping out to stand among the
stars, you hail the desert and hate the city, and
glancing toward the tent of the Armenian Khadra,
you shout aloud to astonished MacWhirter,</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"I will take some savage woman, she shall rear my dusky race."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>But as the day draws forward, and you see the
same forms and the same life that Abraham saw,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_756" id="Page_756">[Pg 756]</a></span>
and know that Joseph leading Mary into Egypt
might pass you to-day, nor be aware of more
than a single sunset since he passed before, then
you feel that this germ, changeless at home, is
only developed elsewhere&mdash;that the boundless
desert freedom is only a resultless romance.</p>

<p>The sun sets and the camp is pitched. The
shadows are grateful to your eye, as the dry air
to your lungs. But as you sit quietly in the
tent-door, watching the Armenian camp and the
camels, your cheeks pales suddenly as you remember
Abraham, and that "he sat in the tent-door
in the heat of the day." Saving yourself,
what of the scene is changed since then? The
desert, the camels, the tents, the turbaned Arabs,
they were what Abraham saw when "he lifted
up his eyes and looked, and, lo! three men stood
by him."</p>

<p>You are contemporary with the eldest history.
Your companions are the dusky figures of vaguest
tradition. The "long result of Time," is not for
you. In that moment you have lost your birthright.
You are Ishmael's brother. You have
your morning's wish. A child of the desert, not
for you are Art, and Poetry, and Science, and the
glowing roll of History shrivels away.</p>

<p>The dream passes as the day dies, and to the
same stars which heard your morning shout of
desert praise, you whisper as you close the tent-door
at evening,</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Better fifty years of Europe, than a cycle of Cathay."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<h3>MOHAMMAD ALEE.</h3>

<p>I do not wonder that Mohammad Alee burned
to be master of Syria, and struck so bravely for it.</p>

<p>His career was necessarily but a brilliant bubble,
and his success purely personal. That career
was passed before the West fairly understood
it. It was easier for the Jews to believe
good from Nazareth than for us to credit genius
in Egypt, and we should as soon have dreamed
of old mummied Cheops throned upon the great
pyramid and ruling the Pharaohs' realm anew,
as of a modern king there, of kingliness unsurpassed
in the century, except by Napoleon,
working at every disadvantage, yet achieving
incredible results.</p>

<p>He was the son of a fisherman&mdash;made his way
by military skill&mdash;recognized the inherent instability
of the Mameluke government then absolute
in Egypt, and which was only a witless tyranny,
sure to fall before ambitious sense and skill. He
propitiated the Sublime Porte, whose Viceroy in
Egypt was only a puppet of state, practically
imprisoned by the Mamelukes in the citadel&mdash;and
he gained brilliant victories in the Hedjaz,
over the Wahabys, infidel and schismatic Muslim.</p>

<p>In 1811, he accomplished the famous massacre
of the Mamelukes in the court of the citadel, of
which Horace Vernet has painted so characteristic
a picture, and for which Mohammad Alee
has been much execrated.</p>

<p>But in Turkish politics, humanity is only a
question of degree. With Mohammad Alee and
the Mamelukes it was diamond cut diamond.
They were a congregation of pestilent vapors, a
nest of hoary-headed tyrants, whom it was a
satisfaction to Humanity and Decency to smoke
out and suffocate in any way. Mohammad Alee
had doubtless little enough rose-water in his
policy to satisfy the grimmest Carlyle. The
leader of sanguinary Albanians and imbruted
Egyptians against wild Arab hordes is not likely
to be of a delicate stomach.</p>

<p>But he was clear-eyed and large-minded. He
had the genius of a statesman rather than the
shrewdness of a general, although as a soldier
he was singularly brave and successful. Of all
his acts the massacre of the Mamelukes was perhaps
the least bloody, because, by crushing the
few heads he had won the victory. A sudden
and well-advised bloodshed is often sure to issue
in a peace which saves greater misery. It was
Cromwell's rule and it was Napoleon's&mdash;it was
also Mohammad Alee's, and the results usually
proved its wisdom.</p>

<p>Moreover, in the matter of this massacre, the
balance of sympathy is restored by the fact that
only a short time previous to the Mamelukes'
Banquet of Death in the citadel, they had arranged
Mohammad Alee's assassination upon his
leaving Suez. By superior cunning he ascertained
the details of this pleasant plan, and publicly
ordered his departure for the following
morning, but privately departed upon a swift-trotting
dromedary in the evening. There was
great consequent frustration of plan and confusion
of soul among the Mamelukes, who had
thought, in this ingenious manner, to cut the
knot of difficulty, and they were only too glad
to hurry with smooth faces to the Pacha's festival&mdash;too
much in a hurry, indeed, to reflect upon
his superior cunning and to be afraid of it. They
lost the game. They were the diamond cut, and
evidently deserve no melodious tear.</p>

<p>Mohammad Alee thus sat as securely in his seat
as a Turkish Pacha can ever hope to sit. He
assisted the Porte in the Greek troubles, perpetrating
other massacres there; and afterward,
when Abdallah, Pacha of Acre, rebelled against
"the Shadow," Mohammad Alee was sent to subdue
him. He did so, and then interceded with
the Porte for Abdallah's safety.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Mohammad Alee had ascertained
his force, and was already sure of the genius to
direct it. He had turned the streams of French
and English skill into the agriculture, manufactures,
and military discipline of Egypt. His
great aim for years had been to make Egypt independent&mdash;to
revive the ancient richness of the
Nile valley, and to take a place for Egypt among
the markets of the world. He accomplished this
so far, that, restoring to the plain of Thebes the
indigo which was once famous there, he poured
into the European market so much and so good
indigo that the market was sensibly affected.
His internal policy was wrong, but we can not
here consider it.</p>

<p>Watching and waiting, in the midst of this internal
prosperity and foreign success and amazement,
while Egyptian youth were thronging to
the Parisian Universities, and the Parisian youth
looked to Egypt as the career of fame and fortune&mdash;as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_757" id="Page_757">[Pg 757]</a></span>
the young Spaniards of a certain period
looked to the diamond-dusted Americas&mdash;in the
midst of all the web Mohammad Alee sat nursing
his ambition and biding his time.</p>

<p>Across the intervening desert, Syria wooed
him to take her for his slave. Who was there
to make him afraid? Leaning on Lebanon, and
laving her beautiful feet in the sea, she fascinated
him with love. He should taste boundless
sway. Eastward lay Bagdad and Persia, thrones
of Caliphs who once sat in his seat&mdash;why should
not he sit in theirs? Then with softer whispers
she pointed to the Golden Horn and the Bosphorus,
and looked what she dared not speak.</p>

<p>I do not wonder that he was enchanted. I do
not wonder that he burned to be master of the
superb slave that lay so lovely and fair in the
sun, dreaming, as now we see her dream, under
the vines and olives. His peer, Napoleon Bonaparte,
against whom, in Egypt, his maiden sword
was fleshed, whom he loved to name and to hear
that they were born in the same year, had thus
seen from Elba the gorgeous Fata-Morgana of
European empire. How could Mohammad Alee
reflect that sallying forth to grasp it, that peer
had bitten the dust? That fate deterred the
Pacha, as the experience of others always deters
ourselves&mdash;as a blade of grass stays the wind.
Shall not you and I, my reader, swim to our
Heros, though a thousand Leanders never came
to shore?</p>

<p>It was this Syria through which we plod, this
brilliant morning, that seduced Mohammad Alee.</p>

<p>A land of glorious resources and without a
population. Here grow wheat, rye, barley, beans
and the cotton plant. Oats are rare; but Palestine
produces sesame and dourra, a kind of pulse
like lentils. Baalbec grows maize. Sugar and
rice are not unknown at Beyrout. Lebanon is
wreathed with vines. Indigo flourishes without
cultivation on the banks of the Jordan. The
Druses cultivate the white mulberry. Gaza has
dates like those of Mecca, and pomegranates as
fine as those of Algiers. Figs and bananas make
the gardens of Antioch tropical. From Aleppo
come pistachio-nuts. The almond, the olive and
the orange thrive in the kindly air; and Damascus
revels in twenty kinds of apricot, with all the
best fruits of France.</p>

<p>Many of the inhabitants pass us, and we can
see what they are. They are repulsive in appearance,
the dregs of refuse races. They look
mean and treacherous, and would offer small resistance
to determination and skill. Mohammad
Alee had little fear of the Syrians.</p>

<p>He could not resist the song of the Siren;
and suddenly "the Eastern Question" agitated
political Europe, and the diplomatic genius of
the three greatest states&mdash;England, France and
Russia&mdash;was abruptly challenged by the alarming
aspect of the Syrian war, which threatened,
with a leader despising the political stagnation
and military imbecility of the vast realm of "the
Shadow of God on Earth," to issue in a new
empire.</p>

<p>Mohammad Alee having subdued Abdallah,
Pacha of Acre, and saved his life and throne by
intercession with the Porte, was surprised that
Abdallah harbored all fugitives from Egypt. He
observed that, following his own example, Abdallah
was introducing the European discipline
into his army, and was enticing into his service
many young officers who had been Europeanly
instructed at his own expense. He expostulated
with Abdallah, and appealed to the Porte. The
Sublime Porte, like other political Sublimities,
hesitated, meditated&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Then idly twirled his golden chain,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And smiling, put the question by."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Mohammad Alee, with expectant eyes fixed
upon Syria, sat silent, his hand trembling with
eagerness and ready to grasp the splendid prize.
"The cloud-capped towers, the gorgeous palaces"
of a new oriental empire rose, possible in the
light of hope.</p>

<p>His army was carefully disciplined. The fame
of its tried officers had been won upon the battle-fields
of the Empire. He had a fleet and all
the resources of the latest military and marine
science. Over all, he had his son Ibrahim, already
proved in Arabia and Greece, of a military
genius peculiarly Oriental, swift and stern, rude
in thought, but irresistible in action&mdash;the slave
of his father's ambition, the iron right-hand of
his will. Internal prosperity and external prestige
sealed Mohammad Alee's hope and determination.</p>

<p>Against him was arrayed the worldly magnificence
of the Ottoman Porte. But the bannered
Muslim lance that had thundered at the gates of
Constantinople, and entering, had planted itself
upon the earliest Christian church, and flapped
barbaric defiance at civilization, was rusty and
worm-eaten. Its crimson drapery fluttering, rent,
upon an idle wind, would be inevitably shivered
by the first rough blow of modern steel.</p>

<p>And the great Powers?&mdash;</p>

<p>Their action was, of course, doubtful. There
was a chance of opposition, a probability of interference.
But the grandeur of the stroke was
its safety. From the universal chaos what new
combinations might not be educed!</p>

<p>No sooner, therefore, had the Porte "put the
question by," than Mohammad Alee proceeded
to answer it. The Egyptian army, headed by
Ibrahim Pacha, advanced into Syria, and sat down
before Acre. Cherishing the old grudge against
Abdallah, the Porte, now that a decided part had
been taken, smiled faintly in approval. But the
conduct of the war betrayed resources of ability
and means which kindled terrible suspicions.
The firman came from Stamboul, commanding
the Pacha of Egypt to withdraw into his own
province. He declined, and was declared a rebel.</p>

<p>The bridge thus fell behind him, and only victory
or death lay before.</p>

<p>For six months Ibrahim Pacha lay before
Acre, and on the 27th May, 1832, he entered by
bloody assault the city which Richard C&oelig;ur de
Lion and Philip Augustus had conquered before
him, and from which Napoleon Bonaparte had
retired foiled. The Syrian war began.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_758" id="Page_758">[Pg 758]</a></span>
The victorious army advanced, triumphing.
The Syrian cities fell before it. The stream of
conquest swept northward, overflowing Damascus
as it passed. The war was no longer a quarrel
of two Pachas, it was a question of life or death
for the Turkish Empire. Vainly the Sultan's
choicest generals struggled to stem the torrent.
The proud walls along the Golden Horn trembled,
lest their pride should be for the third time
humbled, and this time, as the last, from the
Asian shore.</p>

<p>Northern and Western Europe stared amazed
at the wonderful spectacle, listening across the
hushed Mediterranean to the clang of arms resounding
in the effete East, as the appalled Romans
heard the gusty roar of the battle of the
Huns high over them, and invisible in the air.</p>

<p>Surely it was only the interference of the three
Powers that saved the Sultan's throne. That
alone deprived us of the pageant of another
oriental military romance, so rapid in inception,
so entire in execution, that we should have better
comprehended those sudden, barbaric descents
of the middle ages, which changed in a moment
the political aspect of the invaded land:&mdash;in a
moment, because the mighty appearance of life
and power was but a mummy, which a blow
would pulverize.</p>

<p>One man, however strong and skillful, could
not withstand the force of Europe, and Mohammad
Alee retired, baffled, before the leaders of
the political Trinity that a few years before had
dethroned Napoleon.</p>

<p>The crisis of his life was passed, and unfavorably
for his hopes and aims. At the age of
sixty-five he relinquished the struggle with Fate,
and still one of the great men of a century, rich
in great men, with no hope before him, and none
behind&mdash;for since kingly genius is not hereditary,
your divine right is a disastrous fiction&mdash;he sank
slowly away into dotage.</p>

<p>Before the end, however, both he and his son
Ibrahim showed themselves to the Europeans
who had watched with such astonished interest
the culmination and decay of their power. Ibrahim
Pacha, with his fangs removed, shook his
harmless rattle, for the last time in the world's
hearing, at a dinner given him by young Englishmen,
at the Reform Club in Pall Mall, and the
wreck of Mohammad Alee, driveling and dozing,
took a hand at whist with young Americans in a
hotel at Naples.</p>

<p>Father and son returned to Egypt and died
there. A vast mosque of alabaster, commenced
by Mohammad Alee, and now finished, crowns
Cairo, "the delight of the imagination." He
wished to be 'buried there; but he lies without
the city walls, in that suburb of tombs, upon the
cracked sides of one of which a Persian poet has
written&mdash;"Each crevice of this ancient edifice is
a half-opened mouth, that laughs at the fleeting
pomp of royal abodes."</p>

<p>All the winds that blow upon Cairo, laugh
that mocking laughter, and in any thoughtful
mood, as you listen to them and look over the
city, you will mark the two alabaster minarets
of Mohammad Alee's mosque, shafts of snow in
the rich blue air, if you will, but yet pointing
upward.</p>

<p>Leaning on Lebanon, and laving her beautiful
feet in the sea, the superb slave he burned to
possess, still dreams in the sun. We look from
the tent door and see her sleeping, and the remembrance
of this last, momentary interest which
disturbed the slumber, reminds us that it will
one day be broken. So fair is the prize, that,
knowing all others desire her as ardently, no
single hand feels strong enough to grasp it, and
the conflict of many ambitions secures her peace.</p>

<p>Yet it is clear that nerve and skill could do
what they have done, and so spare is the population,
so imbecile the government, and so rich
the soil, that a few thousand determined men
could march unresisted through Syria, and possess
the fair and fertile land.</p>


<h3>BAZAARS.</h3>

<p>Christians and Saracens agree in reprobating
the black hat. But the Damascenes declare open
war against it. In 1432, Bertrandon de la Brocqui&egrave;re
entered the city with a "broad beaver
hat," which was incontinently knocked off his
head. Naturally his first movement was "to lift
my fist," but wisdom held his hand, and he desisted,
content to revenge himself by the questionable
inference that it was "a wicked race."</p>

<p>But if it be "wicked" to malign the black hat,
who shall be justified?</p>

<p>This was only a gentle illustration of the bitter
hatred of Christians and all infidels, cherished
by the Damascenes, who are the most orthodox
of Muslim. Indeed, it is only within twenty
years that an accredited English representative
could reside in Damascus, and he maintains an
imposing state. At present, some hundred European
tourists visit the city yearly, and the devout
faithful find reasons for toleration in infidel
gold, which they never found in argument.</p>

<p>Here, too, as every where in Syria, Ibrahim
Pacha has been our ally. He permitted infidels
to ride horses through the streets. "O, Allah!"
exclaimed the religious Damascenes, who are
termed by the Turks <i>Shami-Shoumi</i>, cursed rascals.
"Your Highness suffers Christians to sit
as high as the faithful."</p>

<p>"No, my friends," responded Ibrahim, "you
shall ride dromedaries, which will put you much
above them."</p>

<p>We went into the bazaars to encounter these
enemies of the black hat, and <i>ex-officio</i> riders of
dromedaries. We had a glimpse of their beauty
as we entered the city. But Eastern life is delightful
in detail. It is a mosaic to be closely
studied.</p>

<p>You enter, and the murmurous silence blends
pleasantly with the luminous dimness of the
place. The matting overhead, torn and hanging
in strips along which, gilding them in passing,
the sun slides into the interior, is a heavy tapestry.
The scene is a perpetual fair, not precisely
like Greenwich Fair, or that of the American
Institute, but such as you frequent in Arabian
stories.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_759" id="Page_759">[Pg 759]</a></span>
Bedoueen glide spectrally along, with wild,
roving eyes, like startled deer. Insane Dervishes
and Santons meditate the propriety of braining
the infidel Howadji. Shekhs from distant Asia,
pompous Effendi from Constantinople, Bagdad
traders, cunning-eyed Armenian merchants meet
and mingle, and many of our old friends, the
grizzly-bearded, red-eyed fire-worshipers, somnolently
curled among their goods, eye us, through
the smoke they emit, as perfect specimens of the
proper sacrifice they owe their Deity. All strange
forms jostle and crowd in passing, except those
which are familiar; and children more beautiful
than any in the East, play in the living mazes of
the crowd.</p>

<p>Shopping goes actively on. The merchant
without uncrossing his legs, exhibits his silks
and coarse cottons to the long draped and vailed
figures that group picturesquely about his niche.
Your eye seizes the bright effect of all the gay
goods as you saunter on. Here a merchant lays
by his chibouque and drinks, from a carved glass,
sweet liquorice water, cooled with snow from
Lebanon. Here one closes his niche and shuffles
off to the mosque, followed by his boy-slave
with the chibouque. Here another rises, and
bows, and falls, kissing the floor, and muttering
the noon prayer. Every where there is intense
but languid life.</p>

<p>The bazaars are separated into kinds. That
of the jewelers is inclosed, and you see the Jews,
swarthy and keen-eyed servants of Mammon,
busily at work. Precious stones miserably set,
and handfuls of pearls, opals, and turquoises are
quietly presented to your inspection. There is
no eagerness of traffic. A boy tranquilly hands
you a ring, and another, when you have looked
at the first. You say "<i>la</i>," no, and he retires.</p>

<p>Or you pause over a clumsy silver ring, with
an Arabic inscription upon the flint set in it.
Golden Sleeve ascertains that it is the cipher
of Hafiz. You reflect that it is silver, which is
the orthodox metal, the Prophet having forbidden
gold. You place it upon your finger, with the
stone upon the inside, for so the Prophet wore
his upon the fore-finger, that he might avoid
ostentation. It is a quaint, characteristic, oriental
signet-ring. Hafiz is a common name, it is probably
that of the jeweler who owns the ring. But
you have other associations with the name, and
as you remember the Persian poet, you suffer it
to remain upon your finger, and pay the jeweler
a few piastres. You do not dream that it is enchanted.
You do not know that you have bought
Ala-ed-deen's lamp, and as a rub of that evoked
omnipotent spirits, so a glance at your ring, when
Damascus has become a dream, will restore you
again to the dim bazaar, and the soft eyes of the
children that watch you curiously as you hesitate,
and to the sweet inspiration of Syria.</p>

<p>You pass on into the quarter where the pattens
are made, inlaid with pearl, such as you
remarked upon the feet of the kohl-eyebrowed
houris. Into the shoemakers, where the brilliant
leathers justify better poetry than Hans
Sach's interminable rhymes, though here is only
their music, not their moral. You climb crumbling
steps, and emerge from darkness upon the
top of the bazaar, on a ledge of a Roman ruin,
and look down into the sunny greenness of the
great mosque, which you can not more nearly
approach. Then down, and by all the beautiful
fabrics of the land, hung with the tin-foiled letters
that surround pieces of English prints, and
which the color-loving eye of the Oriental seizes
as an ornament for his own wares, you pass into
the region of drugs and apothecaries, and feel
that you are about visiting that Persian Doctor
in Mecca who dealt in nothing but miraculous
balsams and infallible elixirs, whose potions were
all sweet and agreeable, and the musk and aloe
wood which he burned, diffused a delicious odor
through the shop. Surely he was court-physician
to Zobeide.</p>

<p>Golden Sleeve pauses before an old figure
curled among the bottles and lost in reverie,
saturated, it seems, with opium, and dreaming
its dreams. This is Zobeide's doctor. He had
evidently the elixir of life among those sweet
potions, and has deeply drunk. Life he has preserved;
but little else that is human remains, except
the love that is stronger than life. For as
he opens his vague eyes and beholds us, they
kindle with an inward fire, as if they looked upon
the Philosopher's Stone. That stone is in our
purses; the old magician knows it, and he knows
the charm to educe it. He opens a jar, and a
dreamy odor penetrates our brains. It is distilled
of flowers culled from the gardens of the
Ganges: or is this delicate perfume preferable&mdash;this
zatta, loved of poets and houris, which
came to the doctor's grandfather from Bagdad?</p>

<p>Attar of roses did Golden Sleeve suggest?
Here is the essence of that divinest distillation
of the very heart of summer. But, O opulent
Howadji! no thin, pale, Constantinople perfume
is this, but the viscous richness of Indian roses.
As many wide acres of bloom went to this jar as
to any lyric of Hafiz. It lies as molten gold in
the quaint glass vase. The magician holds it
toward the Syrian sun, and the shadow of a
smile darkens over his withered features. Then,
drop by drop, as if he poured the last honey that
should ever be hived from Hymettus, he suffers
it to exude into the little vials. They are closely
stopped, and sealed, and wrapped in cotton.
And some wintry Christmas in the West the
Howadji shall offer to a fairer than Zobeide those
more than drops of diamond.</p>

<p>Nor this alone&mdash;but the cunning of Arabian
art has sucked the secret of their sweetness from
tea and coffee, from all the wild herbs of Syria,
and from amber. In those small jars is stored
the rich result of endless series of that summer
luxuriance you saw in the vale of Zabulon. Sandal-wood
to burn upon your nargileh, mystic bits
to lay upon your tongue, so that the startled
Bedoueen, as you pass into the bazaar, and
breathe upon him in passing, dreams that you
came from Paradise, and have been kissed by
houris.</p>

<p>Was it not the magic to draw from your purse<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_760" id="Page_760">[Pg 760]</a></span>
the Philosopher's Stone? The court-physician
of Zobeide, relapsing into reverie, smiles vaguely
as he says salaam; as if the advantage were his&mdash;as
if you were not bearing away with you in
those odors the triumphs of the rarest alchemy.</p>

<p>Breathing fragrance, you enter a khan opening
upon the bazaar, that of Assad Pacha, a
stately and beautiful building, consisting of a
lofty domed court, the dome supported by piers,
with a gallery running quite around it. Private
rooms for the choicest goods open out of the
gallery. The court is full of various merchandise,
and merchants from every region sit by
their goods, and smoke placidly as they negotiate.</p>

<p>But we have received visits in our hotel from
an Armenian merchant, young and comely&mdash;why
not Khadra's cousin?&mdash;and he brought with him
silks and stuffs at which all that was feminine
in our nature swelled with delight. Tempted
by his odors, we have come to his garden. The
room is small and square, and rough-plastered.
Upon the floor are strewn long deep boxes, and
the comely young Armenian, in a flowing dark
dress, reveals his treasures.</p>

<p>Scarfs, shawls, stuffs for dresses, morning
gowns and vests, handkerchiefs, sashes, purses,
and tobacco-bags are heaped in rich profusion.
They are of the true Eastern richness, and in
the true Eastern manner they rely upon that
richness for their effect, and not upon their intrinsic
tastefulness. The figures of the embroideries,
for instance, are not gracefully designed,
but the superb material suffices. They
imply that there are none but beautiful women
in the world, and that all women are brunettes.
As the quiet merchant unfolds them, they have
the mysterious charm of recalling all the beautiful
brunettes who have reigned Zenobias, and
Queens of Sheba, and Cleopatras, in the ruined
realm of your past life.</p>

<p>But, Northerners and Westerners, we remember
another beauty. We remember Palma Vecchio's
golden-haired daughter, and the Venetian
pictures, and the stories of angels with sunny
locks, and the radiant Preziosa. The astute
Armenian knows our thoughts. From the beginning
was not the Oriental merchant a magician?</p>

<p>For while we sit smoking and delighted, the
merchant, no less wily than the court-physician
of Zobeide, opens the last box of all, and gradually
unfolds the most beautiful garment the
Howadji have ever seen. The coronation robes
of emperors and kings, the most sumptuous
costumes at court-festivals, all the elaboration
of Western genius in the material and in the
making of dresses, pale and disappear before the
simple magnificence of this robe.</p>

<p>It is a bournouse or Oriental cloak, made of
camel's hair and cloth of gold. The material
secures that rich stiffness essential in a superb
mantle, and the color is an azure turquoise, exquisite
beyond words. The sleeves are cloth of
gold, and the edges are wrought in gold, but
with the most regal taste. It is the only object
purely tasteful that we have seen. Nor is it of
that negative safety of taste, which loves dark
carriages and neutral tints in dress; but magnificent
and imperial, like that of Rachel when
she plays Thisbe, and nets her head with Venetian
sequins. If the rest imply that all women
are beautiful and brunettes, this proclaims the
one superb Blonde, Queen of them all.</p>

<p>"Take that, Leisurlie, it was intended from
the beginning of the world for an English beauty."</p>

<p>"Oh! <i>Kooltooluk!</i> there is not a woman in
England who could wear it."</p>

<p>Through the dewy distances of memory, as
you muse in the dim chamber upon all who
might worthily wear the garment, passes a figure
perfect as morning, crowned with youth, and
robed in grace, for whose image Alpine snows
were purer and Italian skies more soft. But
even while you muse, it passes slowly away out
of the golden gates of possibility into the wide
impossible.</p>

<p>As we stroll leisurely homeward, it is early
afternoon. But the shops are closed&mdash;strange
silence and desertion reign in the Bazaars&mdash;a
few dark turbaned Christians and Jews yet linger,
and a few children play.</p>

<p>"They are gone to the caf&eacute;s and gardens,"
says Golden Sleeve.</p>

<p>&mdash;And we follow them.</p>

<h2>TIGER ROCHE.&mdash;AN IRISH CHARACTER.</h2>


<p>Among the characters distinguished for unbridled
indulgence and fierce passions, who
were, unfortunately, too frequently to be met
with in Ireland in the last century, was one
whose name attained so much celebrity as to
become a proverb. "Tiger Roche," as he was
called, was a native of Dublin, where he was
born in the year 1729. He received the best
education the metropolis could afford, and was
instructed in all the accomplishments then deemed
essential to the rank and character of a gentleman.
So expert was he in the various acquirements
of polite life, that at the age of sixteen he
recommended himself to Lord Chesterfield, then
Lord Lieutenant of Ireland, who offered him,
gratuitously, a commission in the army; but his
friends having other views for him, they declined
it. This seems to have been a serious misfortune
to the young man, whose disposition and
education strongly inclined him to a military life.
His hopes were raised, and his vanity flattered, by
the notice and offer of the viceroy; and in sullen
resentment he absolutely refused to embark in
any other profession his friends designed for him.
He continued, therefore, for several years among
the dissipated idlers of the metropolis, having no
laudable pursuit to occupy his time, and led into
all the outrages and excesses which then disgraced
Dublin.</p>

<p>One night, in patrolling the city with his drunken
associates, they attacked and killed a watch-man,
who, with others, had attempted to quell a
riot they had excited. He was, therefore, compelled
to fly from Dublin. He made his way to
Cork, where he lay concealed for some time, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_761" id="Page_761">[Pg 761]</a></span>
from thence escaped to the plantations in North
America. When the war broke out between
France and England, he entered as a volunteer
in one of the provincial regiments, and distinguished
himself in several engagements with the
Indians in the interest of the French, during
which he seems to have acquired those fierce
and cruel qualities by which those tribes are distinguished.</p>

<p>He was now particularly noticed by his officers
for the intrepidity and spirit he displayed,
and was high in favor with Colonel Massy, his
commander; but an accident occurred of so
humiliating and degrading a nature, as to extinguish
at once all his hopes of advancement. An
officer of Massy's regiment was possessed of a
very valuable fowling-piece which he highly
prized. He missed it from his tent, and made
diligent inquiry after it, but it was nowhere to
be found. It was, however, reported that it was
seen in the possession of Roche, and an order
was made to examine his baggage. On searching
among it the lost article was found. Roche
declared that he had bought it from one Bourke,
a countryman of his own, and a corporal in his
regiment. Bourke was sent for and examined.
He solemnly declared on oath that the statement
of Roche was altogether false, and that he himself
knew nothing at all of the transaction.
Roche was now brought to a court-martial, and
little appearing in his favor, he was convicted of
the theft, and, as a lenient punishment, ordered
to quit the service with every mark of disgrace
and ignominy. Irritated with this treatment,
Roche immediately challenged the officer who
had prosecuted him. He refused, however, to
meet him, on the pretext that he was a degraded
man, and no longer entitled to the rank and consideration
of a gentleman. Stung to madness,
and no longer master of himself, he rushed to
the parade, insulted the officer in the grossest
terms, and then flew to the picket-guard, where
he attacked the corporal with his naked sword,
declaring his intention to kill him on the spot.
The man with difficulty defended his life, till his
companions sprung upon Roche and disarmed
him. Though deprived of his weapon, he did
not desist from his intention; crouching down
like an Indian foe, he suddenly sprung, like
Roderick Dhu, at his antagonist, and fastened
on his throat with his teeth, and before he could
be disengaged nearly strangled him, dragging
away a mouthful of flesh, which, in the true Indian
spirit, he afterward said was "the sweetest
morsel he had ever tasted." From the fierce
and savage character he displayed on this occasion,
he obtained the appellation of "Tiger," an
affix which was ever after joined to his name.</p>

<p>A few days after, the English army advanced
to force the lines of Ticonderoga. Unfortunate
Roche was left desolate and alone in the wilderness,
an outcast from society, apparently abandoned
by all the world. His resolution and fidelity
to his cause, however, did not desert him.
He pursued his way through the woods till he
fell in with a party of friendly Indians, and by
extraordinary exertions and forced marches, arrived
at the fortress with his Indians, to join in
the attack. He gave distinguished proofs of his
courage and military abilities during that unfortunate
affair, and received four dangerous wounds.
He attracted the notice of General Abercrombie,
the leader of the expedition; but the stain of
robbery was upon him, and no services, however
brilliant, could obliterate it.</p>

<p>From hence he made his way to New York,
after suffering incredible afflictions from pain,
poverty, and sickness. One man alone, Governor
Rogers, pitied his case, and was not satisfied
of his guilt. In the year 1785, Roche received
from his friends in Ireland a reluctant supply of
money, which enabled him to obtain a passage
on board a vessel bound for England, where he
arrived shortly afterward. He reserved part of
his supply of money for the purchase of a commission,
and hoped once more to ascend to that
rank from which he had been, as he thought,
unjustly degraded; but just as the purchase was
about to be completed, a report of his theft in
America reached the regiment, and the officers
refused to serve with him. With great perseverance
and determined resolution, he traced the
origin of the report to a Captain Campbell, then
residing at the British Coffee-house, in Charing-cross.
He met him in the public room, taxed
him with what he called a gross and false calumny,
which the other retorted with great spirit.
A duel immediately ensued, in which both were
desperately wounded.</p>

<p>Roche now declared in all public places, and
caused it to be every where known, that, as he
could not obtain justice on the miscreant who
had traduced his character in America, he would
personally chastise every man in England who
presumed to propagate the report. With this
determination, he met one day, in the Green Park,
his former colonel, Massy, and another officer, who
had just returned home. He addressed them, and
anxiously requested they would, as they might,
remove the stain from his character. They treated
his appeal with contempt, when he fiercely
attacked them both. They immediately drew
their swords, and disarmed him. A crowd of
spectators assembled round, and being two to
one they inflicted severe chastisement on Roche.
Foiled in his attempt, he immediately determined
to seek another occasion, and finding that one
of them had departed for Chester, Roche set out
after him with the indefatigable perseverance
and pursuit of a bloodhound. Here Roche again
sought him, and meeting him in the streets,
again attacked him. Roche was, however, again
defeated, and received a severe wound in the
sword-arm, which long disabled him.</p>

<p>But that redress to his character now came
accidentally and unexpectedly, which all his activity
and perseverance could not obtain. Bourke,
the corporal, was mortally wounded by a scalping
party of Indians, and on his death-bed made a
solemn confession that he himself had actually
stolen the fowling-piece, and sold it to Roche,
without informing him by what means he had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_762" id="Page_762">[Pg 762]</a></span>
procured it, and that Roche had really purchased
it without any suspicion of the theft. This declaration
of the dying man was properly attested,
and universally received, and restored the injured
Roche at once to character and countenance.
His former calumniators now vied with each
other in friendly offers to serve him; and as a
remuneration for the injustice and injury he had
suffered, a lieutenancy in a newly-raised regiment
was conferred upon him gratuitously. He
soon returned to Dublin with considerable eclat;
the reputation of the injuries he had sustained,
the gallant part he had acted, and the romantic
adventures he had encountered among the Indians,
in the woods of America, were the subject
of every conversation. Convivial parties were
every where made for him. Wherever he appeared,
he was the lion of the night. A handsome
person, made still more attractive by the
wounds he had received, a graceful form in the
dance, in which he excelled, and the narrative
of "his hair-breadth 'scapes," with which he
was never too diffident to indulge the company,
made him at this time "the observed of all observers"
in the metropolis of Ireland.</p>

<p>But a service which he rendered the public in
Dublin deservedly placed him very high in their
esteem and good-will. It was at this time infested
with those miscreants who were known by
the names of "sweaters," or "pinkindindies,"
and every night some outrage was perpetrated
on the peaceable and unoffending inhabitants.
One evening late, an old gentleman with his son
and daughter, were returning home from a friend's
house, when they were attacked on Ormond-quay
by a party of them. Roche, who was accidentally
going the same way at the same time, heard
the shrieks of a woman crying for assistance,
and instantly rushed to the place. Here he did
not hesitate singly to meet the whole party. He
first rescued the young woman from the ruffian
who held her, and then attacking the band, he
desperately wounded some, and put the rest to
flight. His spirited conduct on this occasion
gained him a high and deserved reputation, and
inspired others with resolution to follow his example.
He formed a body, consisting of officers
and others of his acquaintance, to patrol the dangerous
streets of Dublin at night, and so gave
that protection to the citizens which the miserable
and decrepit watch were not able to afford.</p>

<p>But he was not fated long to preserve the high
character he had acquired. His physical temperament,
impossible to manage, and his moral
perceptions, hard to regulate, were the sport of
every contingency and vicissitude of fortune.
The peace concluded in 1763 reduced the army,
and he retired in indigent circumstances to London,
where he soon lived beyond his income. In
order to repair it, he paid his addresses to a Miss
Pitt, who had a fortune of &pound;4000. On the
anticipation of this, he engaged in a career of
extravagance that soon accumulated debts to a
greater amount, and the marriage portion was
insufficient to satisfy his creditors. He was arrested
and cast into the prison of the King's
Bench, where various detainers were laid upon
him, and he was doomed to a confinement of
hopeless termination. Here his mind appears
to have been completely broken down, and the
intrepid and daring courage, which had sustained
him in so remarkable a manner through all the
vicissitudes of his former life, seemed to be totally
exhausted. He submitted to insults and indignities
with patience, and seemed deprived not
only of the capability to resent, but of the sensibility
to feel them.</p>

<p>On one occasion he had a trifling dispute with
a fellow-prisoner, who kicked him, and struck
him a blow in the face. There was a time when
his fiery spirit would not have been satisfied but
with the blood of the offender. He now only
turned aside and cried like a child. It happened
that his countryman, Buck English, a personage
of some notoriety, was confined at the same time
in the Bench; with him also he had some dispute,
and English, seizing a stick, flogged him in a
savage manner. Roche made no attempt to retaliate
or resist, but crouched under the punishment.
But while he shrunk thus under the
chastisement of men, he turned upon his wife,
whom he treated with such cruelty, that she was
compelled to separate from him, and abandon
him to his fate.</p>

<p>At length, however, an act of grace liberated
him from a confinement under which all his
powers were fast sinking; and a small legacy,
left him by a relation, enabled him once more to
appear in the gay world. With his change of
fortune a change of disposition came over him;
and in proportion as he had shown an abject
spirit in confinement, he now exhibited even a
still more arrogant and irritable temper than he had
ever before displayed. He was a constant frequenter
of billiard tables, where he indulged in
insufferable assumption, with sometimes a shrewd
and keen remark. He was one day driving the
balls about with the cue, and on some one expostulating
with him that he was not playing
himself, but hindering other gentlemen from their
amusement; "Gentlemen!" said Roche, "why,
sir, except you and I, and one or two more, there
is not a gentleman in the room." His friend afterwards
remarked that he had grossly offended
a large company, and wondered some of them
had not resented the affront. "Oh!" said Roche,
"there was no fear of that. There was not a
thief in the room that did not consider himself
<i>one</i> of the <i>two</i> or <i>three</i> gentlemen I excepted!"</p>

<p>Again his fortune seemed in the ascendant,
and the miserable, spiritless, flogged and degraded
prisoner of the King's Bench, was called on
to stand as candidate to represent Middlesex in
Parliament. So high an opinion was entertained
of his daring spirit, that it was thought by some
of the popular party he might be of use in intimidating
Colonel Luttrell, who was the declared
opponent of Wilkes at that election. In April,
1769, he was put into nomination at Brentford
by Mr. Jones, and seconded by Mr. Martin, two
highly popular electors. He, however, disappointed
his friends, and declined the poll, induced,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_763" id="Page_763">[Pg 763]</a></span>
it was said, by promises of Luttrell's friends to
provide for him. On this occasion he fought
another duel with a Captain Flood, who had offended
him in a coffee-house. He showed no
deficiency of courage, but on the contrary even a
larger proportion of spirit and generosity than had
distinguished him at former periods.</p>

<p>Returning at this time one night to his apartments
at Chelsea, he was attacked by two ruffians,
who presented pistols to his breast. He
sprang back, and drew his sword, when one of
them fired at him, and the ball grazed his temple.
He then attacked them both, pinned one to the
wall, and the other fled. Roche secured his prisoner,
and the other was apprehended next day.
They were tried at the Old Bailey, and capitally
convicted; but at the humane and earnest intercession
of Roche, their punishment was mitigated
to transportation.</p>

<p>All the fluctuations of this strange man's character
seemed at length to settle into one unhappy
state, from which he was unable ever again to
raise himself. He met with a young person,
walking with her mother in St. James's Park, and
was struck with her appearance. He insinuated
himself into their acquaintance, and the young
lady formed for him a strong and uncontrollable
attachment. She possessed a considerable fortune,
of which Roche became the manager. His
daily profusion and dissipation soon exhausted
her property, and the mother and daughter were
compelled to leave London, reduced to indigence
and distress, in consequence of the debts in which
he had involved them.</p>

<p>He was soon after appointed captain of a company
of foot in the East India service, and embarked
in the Vansittart, for India, in May, 1773.
He had not been many days on board, when such
was his impracticable temper that he fell out with
all the passengers, and among the rest with a
Captain Ferguson, who called him out as soon as
they arrived at Madeira. Roche was again seized
with a sudden and unaccountable fit of terror,
and made submission. The arrogance and cowardice
he displayed revolted the whole body of
the passengers, and they unanimously made it a
point that the captain should expel him from the
table. He was driven, therefore, to the society
of the common sailors and soldiers on board the
ship. With them he endeavored to ingratiate
himself, by mixing freely with them, and denouncing
vengeance against every gentleman and
officer on board the ship; but his threats were
particularly directed against Ferguson, whom he
considered the origin of the disgrace he suffered.
On the arrival of the ship at the Cape, after all
the passengers were disembarked, Roche came
ashore, in the dusk of the evening, and was seen
about the door of the house where Ferguson
lodged. A message was conveyed to Ferguson,
who went out, and was found soon afterward
round the corner of the house, weltering in his
blood, with <i>nine</i> deep wounds, all on his left side;
and it was supposed they must have been there
inflicted, because it was the unprotected side, and
the attack was made when he was off his guard.</p>

<p>Suspicion immediately fixed on Roche as the
murderer; he fled during the night, and took refuge
among the Caffres. It was supposed that
he ended his strange and eventful life soon after.
The Cape was at that time a colony of the Dutch,
who, vigilant and suspicious of strangers, suffered
none to enter there, but merely to touch for
provisions and pass on. The proceedings, therefore,
of their colonial government were shut up
in mystery. It was reported at the time, that
Roche was demanded and given up to the authorities
at the Cape, who caused him to be broken
alive upon the wheel, according to the then Dutch
criminal law of the Cape, which inflicted that
punishment on the more atrocious murderers, and
the uncertainty that hung about the circumstance
assorted strangely with the wild character of the
man.</p>

<p>It appears, however, he was tried by the Dutch
authorities at the Cape, and acquitted. He then
took a passage in a French vessel to Bombay;
but the Vansittart, in which he had come from
England to the Cape, had arrived in India before
him; information had been given to the British
authorities, charging Roche with Ferguson's murder;
and Roche was arrested as soon as he landed.
He urged his right to be discharged, or at
least bailed, on the grounds that there was not
sufficient evidence against him; that he had been
already acquitted; and that as the offense, if any,
was committed out of the British dominions,
he could only be tried by special commission,
and it was uncertain whether the Crown would
issue one or not, or, if the Crown did grant a
commission, when or where it would sit. He argued
his own case with the skill of a practiced
lawyer. The authorities, however, declined either
to bail or discharge him, and he was kept in custody
until he was sent a prisoner to England, to
stand his trial.</p>

<p>An appeal of murder was brought against him,
and a commission issued to try it. The case
came on at the Old Bailey, in London, before
Baron Burland, on the 11th December, 1775. The
counsel for Roche declined in any way relying on
the former acquittal at the Cape of Good Hope;
and the case was again gone through. The fact
of the killing was undisputed, but from the peculiar
nature of the proceedings, there could not be,
as in a common indictment for murder, a conviction
for manslaughter; and the judge directed
the jury, if they did not believe the killing to be
malicious and deliberate, absolutely to acquit the
prisoner. The jury brought in a verdict of acquittal.</p>

<p>The doubt about Roche's guilt arose on the
following state of facts. On the evening of their
arrival at the Cape, Ferguson and his friends
were sitting at tea, at their lodgings, when a
message was brought into the room; on hearing
which Ferguson rose, went to his apartment, and,
having put on his sword and taken a loaded cane
in his hand, went out. A friend named Grant
followed him, and found Roche and him at the
side of the house, round a corner, and heard the
clash of swords, but refused to interfere. It was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_764" id="Page_764">[Pg 764]</a></span>
too dark to see what was occurring; but in a few
moments he heard Roche going away, and Ferguson
falling. Ferguson was carried in, and died
immediately. All his wounds were on the <i>left</i>
side. The most violent vindictive feelings had
existed between them; and there was proof of
Roche's having threatened "to shorten the race
of the Fergusons." The message, in answer to
which Ferguson went out, was differently stated,
being, according to one account, "Mr. Mathews
wants Mr. Ferguson," and to the other, "a gentleman
wants Mr. Mathews." The case for the
prosecution was, that this message was a trap to
draw Ferguson out of the house, and that, on his
going out, Roche attacked him; and this was
confirmed by the improbability of Roche's going
out for an innocent purpose, in a strange place,
on the night of his landing, in the dark, and in
the neighborhood of Ferguson's lodgings; and
particularly by the wounds being on the left side,
which they could not be if given in a fair fight
with small swords. Roche's account was, that
on the evening of his arrival he went out to see
the town, accompanied by a boy, a slave of his
host; that they were watched by some person
till they came near Ferguson's, when that person
disappeared, and immediately afterward,
Roche was struck with a loaded stick on the
head, knocked down, and his arm disabled; that
afterward he succeeded in rising, and; perceiving
Ferguson, drew his sword, and, after a struggle,
in which he wished to avoid bloodshed,
killed his assailant in self-defense. This was, to
some extent, corroborated by the boy at the Dutch
trial, and by a sailor in England, but both these
witnesses were shaken a little in their testimony.
According to this account, the message was a
concerted signal to Ferguson, who had set a watch
on Roche, intending to assassinate him. The locality
of Ferguson's wounds was accounted for
by his fighting both with cane and sword, using
the former to parry. If the second version of the
message was correct, it would strongly confirm
this account. There was no proof that Ferguson
knew any one named Mathews.</p>

<p>A writer of the last century, in speaking of the
Irish character, concludes with the remark: "In
short, if they are good, you will scarcely meet a
better: if bad, you will seldom find a worse."
These extremes were frequently mixed in the
same person. Roche, at different periods, displayed
them. At one time, an admirable spirit, great
humanity, and unbounded generosity; at another,
abject cowardice, ferocity, treachery, and brutal
selfishness. The vicissitudes of his fortune were
as variable as his character: at times he was exposed
to the foulest charges, and narrowly escaped
ignominious punishment; at others, he
was the object of universal esteem and admiration.</p>

<h2>WIVES OF GREAT LAWYERS.</h2>


<p>Lawyers do not marry with the impulsiveness
of poets. For they are a prudent class&mdash;mostly
shrewd, practical men&mdash;any thing but
dreamers; and though they may admire a handsome
figure, and like a pretty face as other men
do, they have not usually allowed those adventitious
gifts of nature to divert their attention
from the "main chance" in choosing a wife.
Lawyers are, take them as a whole, a marrying
class, and they not unfrequently enjoy that
"lawyer's blessing," a large family. Take the
Lord Chancellors, for instance. Lord Clarendon,
Lords-Keeper Coventry, Lyttleton, Bridgeman,
Judge Jeffries, Lord York, Lord Bathurst,
Lord Loughborough, and Lord Erskine, were
twice married; Lord Shaftesbury, Lord Maynard,
and Lord Harcourt, were three times married.
The wives whom they chose were usually heiresses,
or rich widows; those who remained
bachelors, or who married "for love," seem to
have formed the exceptions. And yet, on the
whole, the married life of the Lord Chancellors,
judging from Lord Campbell's Lives, seems to
have been comfortable and happy.</p>

<p>The great Lord Bacon, when a young man
plodding at the bar, but with a very small practice,
cast about his eyes among the desirable
matches of the day, and selected the handsome
widow of Sir William Hutton (nephew and heir
of Lord Chancellor Hutton), who had a large
fortune at her own disposal. But another legal
gentleman had been beforehand with him; and
when he proposed he was rejected. His favored
rival was Sir Edward Coke, a crabbed widower,
but attorney-general, rich and of large estate, as
well as of large family. The widow who valued
wealth as much as Bacon did, married the old
man, running off with him, and entering into an
irregular marriage, for which they were both
prosecuted in the Ecclesiastical Court. Bacon
had reason to rejoice at his escape, for the widow
was of capricious and violent temper, and led
Coke a most wretched life, refusing to take his
name, separating from him, doing every thing
to vex and annoy him, and teaching his child to
rebel against him. Bacon was however shortly
after consoled by a rich and handsome wife, in
the daughter of Alderman Barnham, whom he
married. But the marriage seems at best to have
been one of convenience on his part. They did
not live happily together; she never was a companion
to him; and not long before his death, a
final separation took place, and the great Lord
Chancellor died without the consolations of female
tenderness in his last moments. When
the separation took place, "for great and just
causes," as he expresses it in his will, he "utterly
revoked" all testamentary dispositions in
her favor. But she lost nothing by this, for his
costly style of living during his official career
left him without a penny, and he died insolvent.</p>

<p>Sir Thomas More, when twenty-one, married
the eldest daughter of one "Maister Coult, a
gentleman of Essex," a country girl, very ill-educated,
but fair and well-formed. Erasmus
says of the marriage&mdash;"He wedded a young girl
of respectable family, but who had hitherto lived
in the country with her parents and sisters; and
was so uneducated, that he could mould her to
his own tastes and manners. He caused her to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_765" id="Page_765">[Pg 765]</a></span>
be instructed in letters; and she became a very
skillful musician, which peculiarly pleased him."
The union was a happy one, but short, the wife
dying, and leaving behind her a son and three
daughters; shortly after which, however, More
married again, this time a widow named Alice
Middleton, seven years older than himself, and
not by any means handsome. Indeed, More indulged
himself in a jest on her want of youth
and beauty&mdash;"<i>nec bella nec puella</i>." He had
first wooed her, it seems, for a friend, but ended
by marrying her himself. Erasmus, who was
often an inmate of the family, speaks of her as
"a keen and watchful manager." "No husband,"
continues Erasmus, "ever gained so much
obedience from a wife by authority and severity,
as More won by gentleness and pleasantry.
Though verging on old age, and not of a yielding
temper, he prevailed on her to take lessons
on the lute, the viol, the monochord, and the
flute, which she daily practiced to him." Her
ordinary and rather vulgar apprehension could
not fathom the conscientious scruples of her
husband in his refusal to take the oath dictated
to him by Henry VIII.; and when he was at
length cast by that bad monarch into the Tower,
then the grave of so many royal victims, his wife
strongly expostulated with him on his squeamishness.
"How can a man," she said to him on
one occasion, "taken for wise, like you, play the
fool in this close filthy prison, when you might
be abroad at your liberty, if you would but do as
the bishops have done?" She dilated upon his
fine house at Chelsea, his library, gallery, garden,
and orchard, together with the company of
his wife and children. But to all he opposed
the mild force of his conscience and religious
feelings. "Is not this house," he asked, "as
nigh heaven as my own?" to which her contemptuous
ejaculation was&mdash;"<i>Tilly vally, tilly
vally!</i>" He persisted in his course, and was executed,
after which we hear no more of his wife.</p>

<p>Among the few great lawyers who have married
"for love," Hyde, Lord Clarendon, deserves
a place. While yet a young man, he became
desperately enamored of the daughter of Sir
George Aycliffe, a Wiltshire gentleman of good
family, though of small fortune. A marriage
was the result, but the beautiful young wife died
only six months after, of the malignant small-pox
(then a frightful scourge in this country),
and Hyde was for some time so inconsolable, that
he could scarcely be restrained from throwing up
his profession and going abroad. Two years
after, however, he married again into a good
family, his second wife being the daughter of
Sir Thomas Aylesbury, Master of the Mint; and
the marriage proved highly auspicious. This
worthy lady was his companion in all his vicissitudes
of fortune&mdash;lived with him for many years
in exile&mdash;shared all his dangers and privations,
when at times the parents could with difficulty
provide food and raiment for their children; but
the wife was yet preserved to see her husband
Earl of Clarendon, Lord Chancellor and Prime
Minister of England. As an instance of the
straits to which the family was occasionally reduced,
we may quote the following extract from
a letter written by Hyde to a friend, when at
Madrid in 1650, in which he says: "All our
money is gone, and let me never prosper, if I
know or can imagine how we can get bread a
month longer;" and again, "Greater necessities
are hardly felt by any men than we for the present
undergo, such as have almost made me foolish.
I have not for my life been able to supply
the miserable distress of my poor wife."</p>

<p>Francis North, afterward Lord-Keeper Guildford,
went about marrying in a business-like
way. He was a reader at Lincoln's Inn, but
much desired to wed, because he had "grown
tired of dining in the hall, and eating a costelet
and salad at Chateline's in the evening with a
friend." Besides, he wished to mend his fortune
in the most summary way. He first tried
a rich, coquettish young widow, but she jilted
him. Then he found out an alderman who was
reputed to be rich, and had three marriageable
daughters with a fortune of &pound;6000 each. He
made his approaches, was favorably received,
and proceeded to broach the money question to
the alderman. The sum named as the young
lady's portion was &pound;5000; but as North had
set his heart on the &pound;6000, he was disappointed,
and at once took his leave. The alderman, running
after him (at least so relates Lord Campbell),
offered him to boot &pound;500 on the birth of
the first child. But North would not take a
penny under the sum he had fixed upon, and
the match fell through. At last he found a lady
with &pound;14,000, one of the daughters of the Earl
of Devon, whom he courted in a business style,
and ultimately married.</p>

<p>Judge Jeffries, when a dissolute youth, courted
an heiress, and in spite of her father's interdict,
the young lady encouraged Jeffries, and
corresponded with him. The father fell upon
a heap of love-letters which had passed between
Jeffries and his daughter, and in a savage manner
turned the young lady from his doors. She
was suffering great distress in some house in
Holborn, in which she had taken shelter, and
where Jeffries sought her out. Perhaps his marrying
her under such circumstances was the one
generous act of that infamous man's life. She
made him an excellent wife while she lived, but
before she died, Jeffries was already courting another
wife, and married her three months after;
and in about three months after that, his new
wife presented him with certain marital fruits
rather prematurely. This woman caused much
scandal during her life, and seems to have been
as great a disgrace to the domestic conditions
of life, as her husband was to the bench he occupied.</p>

<p>Neither Lord Somers nor Lord Thurlow were
married&mdash;both having been disappointed in attachments
in their younger years. The latter
proposed to a young Lincolnshire lady, a Miss
Gouch, but she protested "she would not have
him&mdash;she was positively afraid of him;" so he
forswore matrimony thenceforward. We do not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_766" id="Page_766">[Pg 766]</a></span>
remember any other of the Lord Chancellors who
have led a single life.</p>

<p>Strange that Lord Chancellor Eldon&mdash;a man
of so much caution and worldly providence, should
have been one of the few great lawyers who married
"for love;" but it was so. His choice was
nearly a penniless beauty, and he had nothing;
she was only eighteen, and he twenty-one. Scott
induced the fair damsel to elope with him; she
stole away from her father's home by night, descending
from her window by a ladder planted
there by her impatient lover; they fled across
the border, and got married at Blackshiels. The
step was an important one for Scott&mdash;fraught
with great consequences; for it diverted him
from the church, for which he had been studying,
and forced him to the bar, thus compelling
him to enter upon a career which ended in the
highest honors. William Scott, his elder brother,
afterward Lord Stowell, helped the young couple
on, and the young lawyer worked with a will.
"I have married rashly," said he, in a letter to
a friend, "and I have neither house nor home to
offer to my wife; but it is my determination to
<i>work hard</i> to provide for the woman I love, as
soon as I can find the means of so doing." He
was shortly after engaged by Sir Robert Chambers,
as his deputy, to read lectures on law at
Oxford; and in after years he used to relate the
following story respecting his first appearance in
the character of a lecturer. "The most awkward
thing that ever occurred to me was this:
immediately after I was married, I was appointed
Deputy Professor of Law, at Oxford; and
the law professor sent me the first lecture, which
I had to read <i>immediately</i> to the students, and
which I began without knowing a word that was
in it. It was upon the statute of <i>young men
running away with maidens</i>. Fancy me reading,
with about one hundred and forty boys and young
men giggling at the professor! Such a tittering
audience no one ever had."</p>

<p>It remains for us to notice the wives of two
other great lawyers, who, though not equal in
rank to those we have named, were equal to any
of them in professional merit, and in true nobility
of character. We allude to the late Sir
Samuel Romilly and Sir James Mackintosh, both
of whom were blessed in their married state, and
have left behind them memorials of the most
touching kind in memory of their wives.</p>

<p>"For fifteen years," says Sir Samuel Romilly,
writing in 1813, "my happiness has been the
constant study of the most excellent of wives;
a woman in whom a strong understanding, the
noblest and most elevated sentiments, and the
most courageous virtue, are united to the warmest
affection, and to the utmost delicacy of mind
and tenderness of heart; and all these intellectual
perfections are graced and adorned by the
most splendid beauty that human eyes ever beheld.
She has borne to me seven children, who
are living, and in all of whom I persuade myself
that I discover the promise of them, one day,
proving themselves not unworthy of such a
mother."</p>

<p>The noble woman here referred to was Anne,
the eldest daughter of Francis Garbett, Esq., of
Knill Court, Herefordshire, whom Romilly married
in January, 1798. He first accidentally met
the young lady when on a visit to the Marquis
of Lansdowne, at Bowood. He gives the following
charming account of the circumstance in
his diary: "The amiable disposition of Lord
and Lady Lansdowne always renders the place
delightful to their guests. To me, besides the
enjoyment of the present moment, there is always
added, when I am at Bowood, a thousand
pleasing recollections of past times; of the happy
days I have spent, of the various society of
distinguished persons I have enjoyed, of the
friendships I have formed here; and above all,
that it was here that I first saw and became
known to my dearest Anne. If I had not chanced
to meet with her here, there is no probability
that I should ever have seen her; for she had
never been, nor was likely, unmarried, to have
been in London. To what accidental causes are
the most important occurrences of our lives sometimes
to be traced! Some miles from Bowood
is the form of a white horse, grotesquely cut out
upon the downs, and forming a landmark to
wide extent of country. To that object it is that
I owe all the real happiness of my life. In the
year 1796 I made a visit to Bowood. My dear
Anne, who had been staying there some weeks,
with her father and her sisters, was about to
leave it. The day fixed for their departure was
the eve of that on which I arrived; and if nothing
had occurred to disappoint their purpose,
I never should have seen her. But it happened
that, on the preceding day, she was one of an
equestrian party which was made to visit this
curious object; she overheated herself by her
ride; a violent cold and pain in her face was
the consequence. Her father found it indispensably
necessary to defer his and her journey for
several days, and in the mean time I arrived. I
saw in her the most beautiful and accomplished
creature that ever blessed the sight and understanding
of man&mdash;a most intelligent mind, an
uncommonly correct judgment, a lively imagination,
a cheerful disposition, a noble and generous
way of thinking, an elevation and heroism of
character, and a warmth and tenderness of affection,
such as is rarely found even in her sex,
were among her extraordinary endowments. I
was captivated alike by the beauties of her person,
and the charms of her mind. A mutual
attachment was formed between us, which, at
the end of a little more than a year, was consecrated
by marriage. All the happiness I have
known in her beloved society, all the many and
exquisite enjoyments which my dear children
have afforded me, even my extraordinary success
in my profession, the labors of which, if my life
had not been so cheered and exhilarated, I never
could have undergone&mdash;all are to be traced to
this trivial cause."</p>

<p>Lady Romilly died on the 29th of October,
1818, and the bereaved husband was unable to
bear up under this terrible loss. The shock occasioned<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_767" id="Page_767">[Pg 767]</a></span>
by her death deprived him of his senses,
and in his despair he committed the fatal act
which laid him in the same grave with his devoted
wife. In life they were united, and in
death they would not be separated.</p>

<p>Mackintosh married when only a young man
in great pecuniary straits. He was living in the
family of Dr. Fraser, London, where Miss Catherine
Stuart, a young Scotch lady, was a frequent
visitor. She was distinguished by a rich fund of
good sense, and an affectionate heart, rather than
for her personal attractions. An affection sprang
up between them, and they got privately married
at Marylebone Church, on February 18th, 1789,
greatly to the offense of the relatives of both
parties.</p>

<p>When composing his <i>Vindici&aelig; Gallic&aelig;</i> at Little
Ealing, his wife sat by him in the room; he could
tolerate no one else, and he required her to be
perfectly quiet&mdash;not even to write or work&mdash;as
the slightest movement disturbed him. In the
evening, by way of recreation, he walked out
with his wife, reading to her as he went along.
This amiable wife died in 1797, when slowly recovering
from the birth of a child, and she left
three daughters behind her. Mackintosh thus
spoke of his departed wife, in a letter to Dr. Parr,
written shortly after his sad bereavement, and
we do not remember ever to have met with a
more beautiful testimony to a deceased wife than
this is:</p>

<p>"In the state of deep, but quiet melancholy,
which has succeeded to the first violent agitations
of my sorrow, my greatest pleasure is to look
back with gratitude and pious affection on the
memory of my beloved wife; and my chief consolation
is the soothing recollection of her virtues.
Allow me, in justice to her memory, to tell you
what she was, and what I owed her. I was guided
in my choice only by the blind affection of my
youth. I found an intelligent companion and a
tender friend, a prudent monitress, the most faithful
of wives, and a mother as tender as children
ever had the misfortune to lose. I met a woman
who, by the tender management of my weaknesses,
gradually corrected the most pernicious
of them. She became prudent from affection;
and though of the most generous nature, she was
taught frugality and economy by her love for me.
During the most critical period of my life, she
preserved order in my affairs, from the care of
which she relieved me. She gently reclaimed me
from dissipation; she propped my weak and irresolute
nature; she urged my indolence to all
the exertions that have been useful and creditable
to me; and she was perpetually at hand to admonish
my heedlessness or improvidence. To her
I owe whatever I am; to her, whatever I shall
be. In her solicitude for my interest, she never
for a moment forgot my feelings, or my character.
Even in her occasional resentment, for
which I but too often gave her cause (would to
God I could recall those moments), she had no
sullenness nor acrimony. Her feelings were
warm and impetuous, but she was placable, tender,
and constant. Such was she whom I have
lost; and I have lost her when her excellent
natural sense was rapidly improving, after eight
years of struggle and distress had bound us fast
together, and moulded our tempers to each other,&mdash;when
a knowledge of her worth had refined my
youthful love into friendship, before age had deprived
it of much of its original ardor. I lost her,
alas! (the choice of my youth, the partner of my
misfortunes) at a moment when I had the prospect
of her sharing my better days. If I had lost
the giddy and thoughtless companion of prosperity,
the world could easily repair the loss; but I
have lost the faithful and tender partner of my
misfortunes, and my only consolation is in that
Being, under whose severe, but paternal chastisement,
I am bent down to the ground."</p>

<p>Mackintosh married, about a year after the
death of his first wife, Catherine, the second
daughter of John Allen, of Cresselly, Co. Pembroke.
She was an amiable and accomplished
woman, and greatly contributed to his happiness
in after life. She died in 1830, at Ch&ecirc;ne, near
Geneva, after a short illness; and her husband,
speaking of her afterward, "in the deep sincerity
of deliberate conviction," calls her "an upright
and pious woman, formed for devoted affection,
who employed a strong understanding and resolute
spirit in unwearied attempts to relieve every
suffering under her view."</p>

<h2>CRIME DETECTED.&mdash;AN ANECDOTE OF THE PARIS POLICE.</h2>


<p>Previously to the year 1789, but at what
precise date can not say, the city of Paris
possessed as guardian of its safety, and chief
minister of police, a man of rare talent and integrity.
At the same period, the parish of St.
Germais, in the quarter of the Rue St. Antoine,
had for its cur&eacute; a kind venerable old man, whose
whole life was spent in doing good to both the
souls and bodies of his fellow-creatures, and
whose holy consistency and dignified courage
caused him to be loved by the good, and respected
by even the most abandoned characters. One
cold dark winter's night, the bell at the old cur&eacute;'s
door was rung loudly, and he, although in bed,
immediately arose and opened the door, anticipating
a summons to some sick or dying bed.</p>

<p>A personage, richly dressed, with his features
partly concealed by a large false beard, stood
outside. Addressing the cur&eacute; in a courteous and
graceful manner, he apologized for his unseasonable
visit, which, as he said, the high reputation
of monsieur had induced him to make.</p>

<p>"A great and terrible, but necessary and inevitable
deed," he continued, "is to be done.
Time presses; a soul about to pass into eternity
implores your ministry. If you come you must
allow your eyes to be bandaged, ask no questions,
and consent to act simply as spiritual consoler
of a dying woman. If you refuse to accompany
me, no other priest can be admitted, and her
spirit must pass alone."</p>

<p>After a moment of secret prayer, the cur&eacute; answered,
"I will go with you." Without asking
any further explanation, he allowed his eyes to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_768" id="Page_768">[Pg 768]</a></span>
be bandaged, and leaned on the arm of his suspicious
visitor. They both got into a coach,
whose windows were immediately covered by
wooden shutters, and then they drove off rapidly.
They seemed to go a long way, and make many
doublings and turnings ere the coach drove under
a wide archway and stopped.</p>

<p>During this time, not a single word had been
exchanged between the travelers, and ere they
got out the stranger assured himself that the
bandage over his companion's eyes had not been
displaced, and then taking the old man respectfully
by the hand, he assisted him to alight and
to ascend the wide steps of a staircase as far as
the second story. A great door opened, as if of
itself, and several thickly-carpeted rooms were
traversed in silence. At length, another door
was opened by the guide, and the cur&eacute; felt his
bandage removed. They were in a solemn-looking
bed-chamber; near a bed, half-vailed by thick
damask curtains, was a small table, supporting
two wax lights, which feebly illuminated the cold
death-like apartment. The stranger (he was the
Duke de &mdash;&mdash;), then bowing to the cur&eacute;, led him
toward the bed, drew back the curtains, and said
in a solemn tone:</p>

<p>"Minister of God, before you is a woman who
has betrayed the blood of her ancestors, and
whose doom is irrevocably fixed. She knows
on what conditions an interview with you has
been granted her; she knows too that all supplication
would be useless. You know your
duty, M. le Cur&eacute;; I leave you to fulfill it, and
will return to seek you in half an hour."</p>

<p>So saying he departed, and the agitated priest
saw lying on the bed a young and beautiful girl,
bathed in tears, battling with despair, and calling
in her bitter agony for the comforts of religion.
No investigation possible! for the unhappy
creature declared herself bound by a terrible
oath to conceal her name; besides, she
knew not in what place she was.</p>

<p>"I am," she said, "the victim of a secret
family tribunal, whose sentence is irrevocable!
More, I can not tell. I forgive mine enemies, as
I trust that God will forgive me. Pray for me!"</p>

<p>The minister of religion invoked the sublime
promises of the gospel to soothe her troubled
soul, and he succeeded. Her countenance, after
a time, became composed, she clasped her hands
in fervent prayer, and then extended them toward
her consoler.</p>

<p>As she did so, the cur&eacute; perceived that the
sleeve of her robe was stained with blood.</p>

<p>"My child," said he, with a trembling voice,
"what is this?"</p>

<p>"Father, it is the vein which they have already
opened, and the bandage, no doubt, was
carelessly put on."</p>

<p>At these words, a sudden thought struck the
priest. He unrolled the dressing, allowed the
blood to flow, steeped his handkerchief in it, then
replaced the bandage, concealed the stained handkerchief
within his vest, and whispered:</p>

<p>"Farewell, my daughter, take courage, and
have confidence in God!"</p>

<p>The half-hour had expired, and the step of
his terrible conductor was heard approaching.</p>

<p>"I am ready," said the cur&eacute;, and having allowed
his eyes to be covered, he took the arm
of the Duke de &mdash;&mdash;, and left the awful room,
praying meanwhile with secret fervor.</p>

<p>Arrived at the foot of the staircase, the old
man, succeeded, without his guide's knowledge,
in slightly displacing the thick bandage so as to
admit a partial ray of lamp light. Finding himself
in the carriage gateway, he managed to
stumble and fall, with both hands forward toward
a dark corner. The duke hastened to raise him,
both resumed their places in the carriage, and,
after repassing through the same tortuous route,
the cur&eacute; was set down in safety at his own door.</p>

<p>Without one moment's delay, he called his
servant.</p>

<p>"Pierre," he said, "arm yourself with a stick,
and give me your support; I must instantly go
to the minister of police."</p>

<p>Soon afterward the official gate was opened to
admit the well-known venerable pastor.</p>

<p>"Monseigneur," he said, addressing the minister,
"a terrible deed will speedily be accomplished,
if you are not in time to prevent it. Let
your agents visit, before daybreak, every carriage
gateway in Paris; in the inner angle of one of
them will be found a blood-stained handkerchief.
The blood is that of a young female, whose
murder, already begun, has been miraculously
suspended. Her family have condemned their
victim to have her veins opened one by one, and
thus to perish slowly in expiation of a fault, already
more than punished by her mortal agony.
Courage, my friend, you have already some
hours. May God assist you&mdash;I can only pray."</p>

<p>That same morning, at eight o'clock, the minister
of police entered the cur&eacute;'s room.</p>

<p>"My friend," said he, "I confess my inferiority,
you are able to instruct me in expedients."</p>

<p>"Saved!" cried the old man, bursting into
tears.</p>

<p>"Saved," said the minister, "and rescued from
the power of her cruel relations. But the next
time, dear abb&eacute;, that you want my assistance in
a benevolent enterprise, I wish you would give
me a little more time to accomplish it."</p>

<p>Within the next twenty-four hours, by an express
order from the king, the Duke de &mdash;&mdash; and
his accomplices were secretly removed from Paris,
and conveyed out of the kingdom.</p>

<p>The young woman received all the care which
her precarious state required; and when sufficiently
recovered, retired to a quiet country village
where the royal protection assured her
safety. It is scarcely needful to say, that next
to her Maker, the curé of St. Germais was the
object of her deepest gratitude and filial love.
During fifteen years, the holy man received from
time to time the expression of her grateful affection;
and at length, when himself, from extreme
old age, on the brink of the grave, he
received the intelligence that she had departed
in peace.</p>

<p>Never until then, had a word of this mysterious<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_769" id="Page_769">[Pg 769]</a></span>
adventure passed the good cur&eacute;'s lips. On
his deathbed, however, he confided the recital to
a bishop, one of his particular friends; and from
a relation of the latter, I myself heard it.
This is the exact truth.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2>ZOOLOGICAL STORIES.</h2>


<p>Travelers' tales have a peculiar reputation
for the marvelous, and many travelers have
been accused of fiction. Whether zoologists'
tales are in all cases to be trusted, we have, now
and then, a doubt. They are true in the main;
but sometimes, possibly, the first narrator of an
unusually good story has judiciously abstained
from sifting it; and once in the Zoological Story-book,
the pleasant tale has stood on its own merits,
and been handled tenderly, as is the way with
ornaments; no man too roughly scratching at
them to find out of what materials they are composed.</p>

<p>Of course we accept legends <i>as</i> legends. It
was once believed of crocodiles, that, after they
had eaten a man comfortably, and left only his
skull, at the sweet kernel of which&mdash;the brain&mdash;they
could not get, their tears were shed over
the bone until they softened it, and so the skull
was opened, and the brain devoured. When
that is told us as a legend, we say, certainly, it
was a very quaint thing to believe of the tears
of crocodiles. Then, travelers' tales of the proverbial
kind are next of kin to legends. Here is
a very marvelous one, and yet, let us be bold and
say that we believe it. It is this. An Indian,
having tamed a rattlesnake, carried it about in a
box with him, and called it his great father. M.
Pinnisance met with him as he was starting for
his winter hunt, and saw him open the box-door
and give the snake his liberty, telling it to be
sure and come back to meet him, when he returned
to the same spot next May. It was then
October. M. Pinnisance laughed at the man,
who immediately saw his way clearly to a speculation
in rum, and betted two gallons that his
snake would keep the appointment. The wager
was made; the second week in May arrived;
the Indian and the Frenchman were on the appointed
spot. The great father was absent, and
the Indian, having lost his wager, offered to repeat
it, doubled, if the snake did not return within
the next two days. That wager the Frenchman
took and lost. The snake, who (had he
speech) might have apologized for being rather
behind his time, appeared, and crawled into his
box. We believe this. Rattlesnakes are teachable;
and, in this instance, the keeping of the
appointment seems to us only an apparent wonder.
Snakes are not given to travel in the winter,
and the Indian's father, turned out of the
box, made himself snug at no great distance
from the place of his ejectment. Winter over,
the Indian came back. His great father may
have been dining heartily, and indisposed to stir;
but, as he grew more brisk, the accustomed invocation
of his little son became effectual, and
brought the tame snake to the box as usual.</p>

<p>Disjonval knew a spider (such a spider was a
person to know) who regularly placed himself
upon the ceiling over a young lady's head whenever
she played the harp, and followed her if
she changed her position. The celebrated violinist,
Berthome (it is our shame never to have
heard of him), when a boy, saw a spider habitually
come out to hear when he was practicing:
this creature at last became familiar, and took a
seat upon the desk. Lenz tells of a goose who
followed a harp-player wherever he performed,
probably to hiss him out of self-respect. Bingley
tells of a pigeon in the neighborhood of a
young lady who played brilliantly on the harpsichord;
the pigeon did not greatly care about her
playing, except when she played the song of
"Speri si," from Handel's opera, Admetus: then
it would come and sit by the window, testifying
pleasure; when the song was over, it would fly
back to its dovecote, for it had not learnt the art
of clapping wings for an encore.</p>

<p>In the matter of experience, we can believe
the story of a dog who either was <i>not</i> blessed
with a love of music, or had a master given to
the perpetration of atrocities against his canine
ear; the dog whose peace was broken by his
master's practice on the violin, took every opportunity
to hide the stick. Plutarch's story of the
mule we are at liberty, we hope, to set down in
the list of pleasant fables. The mule laden with
salt blundered, by chance, into a stream; on
coming out it found its load to be so agreeably
lightened, that it afterward made a point of taking
a bath upon its travels. To cure it of this
trick, the panniers were filled with sponge, and
then when the mule came out of the water with
the sponges saturated, it felt a load that it had
reason to remember.</p>

<p>Dr. Pelican saw a party of rats around the
bunghole of a cask of wine dipping their tails in
and then licking them. Mr. Jesse tells of rats
who performed a similar feat with an oil-bottle.
But this is nothing in comparison with the acuteness
of Degrandpre's monkey. Left with an
open bottle of aniseed brandy, he sucked what
he could from it with tongue and fingers, and
then poured sand into the bottle till the rest ran
over. Le Vaillant, the African traveler, had with
him dogs and a monkey. When the monkey
was weary he leapt on a dog's back for a ride.
One dog on such occasions quietly stood still.
The monkey, fearing to be left behind, would
presently jump off and hasten to the caravan:
the dog, with studious politeness, took good care
to give him precedence. An elephant&mdash;we must
at once append one tale about the elephant, whose
great sagacity makes him the hero of a thousand
and one&mdash;an elephant belonging to an officer in
the Bengal army, was left during the long absence
of his master to a keeper; who, as even
elephant-ostlers will do, cheated him of his rations.
When the master came back, the poor
half-starved elephant testified the greatest joy,
the keeper, in his master's presence, put, of
course, the full allowance of food before the elephant,
who immediately divided it into two parts,
one representing his short commons, which he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_770" id="Page_770">[Pg 770]</a></span>
devoured greedily; the other representing the
amount to which he had been defrauded in his
dinners, he left. The officer of course understood
the hint, and the man confessed his breach
of trust.</p>

<p>We must get rid of another story of an elephant;
like the last, perfectly credible. Elephants
have more sagacity than dogs, and of
dogs few tales that are current are doubtful.
This is the tale of an elephant in the Jardin des
Plantes. A painter used to study from the animals
in the garden, and was minded once to
paint the elephant. But of course he must paint
him in an attitude; and even the sagacity of an
elephant failed to understand that the artist
wished him to keep his mouth open, and hold
up his trunk. The artist therefore got a little
boy, and intrusted to his care a bag of apples,
which he was to throw into the elephant's mouth
one by one, obliging him in this way to keep his
trunk uplifted. "The apples," says Mr. Broderip,
"were numerous, but the painter was not a
Landseer, and as he had not the faculty of seizing
and transferring character with Edwin's
magical power and rapidity, the task was tedious.
By the master's directions, the boy occasionally
deceived the elephant by a simulated chuck, and
thus eked out the supply. Notwithstanding the
just indignation of the balked expectant, his
<i>gourmandise</i> checked his irritable impatience;
and, keeping his eye on the still well-filled bag,
he bore the repeated disappointment, crunching
an apple, when it chanced to come, with apparent
glee. At length the last apple was thrown
and crunched, the empty bag was laid aside, and
the elephant applied himself to his water-tank
as if for the purpose of washing down his repast.
A few more touches would have completed the
picture, when an overwhelming <i>douche</i> from his
well-adjusted trunk obliterated the design, and
drenched the discomfited painter. Having, by
this practical application of retributive justice,
executed judgment on the instigator, the elephant,
disdaining the boy, whom he regarded as the
mere instrument of wrong, marched proudly
round his inclosure, loudly trumpeting forth his
triumph."</p>

<p>We have left that story in the pleasant words
of its accomplished narrator. Mr. Thomson now
shall tell us one in his way, which illustrates the
faculty of imitation: "An oran-otan, brought up
by P&egrave;re Carbasson, became so fond of him, that
wherever he went, it always seemed desirous of
accompanying him; whenever, therefore, he had
to perform the service of his church, he was under
the necessity of shutting him up in a room.
Once, however, the animal escaped, and followed
the father to the church, where, silently mounting
the sounding-board above the pulpit, he lay
perfectly still till the sermon commenced. He
then crept to the edge, and overlooking the
preacher, imitated all his gestures in so grotesque
a manner, that the whole congregation
were unavoidably urged to laugh. The father,
surprised and confounded at this ill-timed levity,
severely rebuked their inattention. The reproof
failed in its effect; the congregation still laughed,
and the preacher, in the warmth of his zeal, redoubled
his vociferations and actions; these the
ape imitated so exactly, that the congregation
could no longer restrain themselves, but burst
out into a loud and continued laughter." Of
course a friend stepped up to acquaint the preacher
with the existence of a second person above
the sounding-board, co-operating with him zealously.
And of course the culprit was taken out
by the servants of the church with a face expressive
of insulted innocence.</p>

<p>There was a dog trained to run on errands for
his master, who was trotting home one evening
along a by-road, with a basket containing hot
pies for his master's supper, when two highwaymen
dogs burst out upon him, and while he dogfully
fought one, the other burglariously broke
into his basket. The dog who was waylaid saw
instantly that fighting would not save the pies;
the pies must go, and it resolved itself into a
question who should eat them. He at once gave
up his contest with the adversary; if the pies
were to be eaten&mdash;among dogs, at least&mdash;his
right was the best, so he immediately darted on
the basket and devoured all that remained.</p>

<p>A story of an elephant again comes to the surface.
At Macassar, an elephant-driver had a
cocoa-nut given him, which he wantonly struck
twice against the elephant's forehead to break it.
The next day, they were passing by some cocoa-nuts
in the street exposed for sale. The elephant
took up one, and began to knock it on the
driver's head; the result, unhappily, was fatal.
Elephants commonly discriminate so well, as to
apportion punishment to the offense against them:
they are considerate, merciful, and magnanimous.
Another story of an elephant, we think, occurs in
one of Mr. Broderip's books. A visitor to an
elephant at a fair, having given to him one by one
a number of good ginger-bread nuts, thought it a
good joke to end by giving him at once a bag full
of the hottest kind. The elephant, distressed
with pain, took bucket-full after bucket-full of
water, and the joker, warned of his danger, had
barely escaped over the threshold before the bucket
was flung violently after his departing figure. A
year afterward, the foolish fellow came again,
with gingerbread in one pocket and hot spice in
the other. He began with his donations of gingerbread,
and then modestly substituted one hot
nut. The moment it was tasted by the elephant,
the offender was remembered, and caught up
into the air by his clothes; his weight tore them,
and he fell, leaving the elephant his tails and
some part of his trousers. The animal putting
them on the floor set his foot upon them, and
having deliberately picked out of the pockets and
eaten all the gingerbread that he considered orthodox,
he trod upon the rest, and threw the tails
away.</p>

<p>The Cape baboons appear to have a tact for
battle, like the Caffres. Lieutenant Shipp headed
twenty men, to recapture sundry coats and trowsers
stolen by a Cape baboon. He made a circuit,
to cut off the marauders from their caverns; they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_771" id="Page_771">[Pg 771]</a></span>
observed him, and detaching a small troop, to
guard the entrance, kept their posts. They could
be seen collecting large stones, under the active
superintendence of an old gray-headed baboon,
who appeared to be issuing his orders as a general.
The soldiers rushed to the attack, when
down came an avalanche of enormous stones, and
Britons left baboons the masters of the situation.</p>

<p>Of monkey-tricks, the Indians have an amusing
fable. A man went on a journey with a
monkey and a goat, and he took with him, for his
refreshment, rice and curds. Arrived at a tank,
the man resolved to bathe and dine. While he
was in his bath, the monkey ate his dinner, and,
having wiped his mouth and paws on the goat's
beard, he left the goat to settle his account. When
the man came out of the bath, and found his dinner
gone, it was quite easy to see, by the goat's
beard, who had stolen it.</p>

<p>The monkey was no ass. The sense of asses
is not rated very high; but that is a mistake about
them. They are shrewder people than we take
them for, and kind-hearted as well. A poor higgler,
living near Hawick, had an ass for his only
companion and partner in the business. The
higgler being palsied, was accustomed to assist
himself often upon the road, by holding to the
ass's tail. Once, on their travels, during a severe
winter, man and ass were plunged into a snow-wreath,
near Rule Water. After a hard struggle,
the ass got out; but, knowing that his helpless
master was still buried, he made his way to him,
and placed himself so that his tail lay ready to
his partner's hand. The higgler grasped it, and
was dragged out to a place of safety. Zoologically
speaking, it ought not to be thought disrespectful
in a man to call his friend "an ass."</p>

<p>Elephants, again. They show their good taste,
and are very fond of children. Dr. Darwin says:
The keeper of an elephant, in his journey in India,
sometimes leaves him fixed to the ground by
a length of chain, while he goes into the woods
to collect food for him; and, by way of reciprocal
attention, asks the elephant to mind his child&mdash;a
child unable to walk&mdash;while he is gone. The
animal defends it; lets it creep about his legs;
and, when it creeps to the extremity of the chain,
he gently wraps his trunk about the infant's body,
and brings it again into the middle of the circle.</p>

<p>And now we can not clear our minds of elephants
without unburthening a story, which we
have from a tale-teller with Indian experience,
and which we imagine to be now first told in
print. It causes us to feel that in a Parliament
of animals, elephants would have divided in favor
of a ten-hours' bill. There was a large ship's
rudder to be floated; men were busy about it
one evening, when a file of elephants were passing,
on the way home from work, and it was
proposed and carried that an elephant might as
well save them their pains, and push the thing
into the water for them. So an elephant was
brought, and put his head down, and appeared to
push with might, but not a beam stirred. Another
was brought to help him, with the same
result; and finally, as many elephants as the
rudder would allow, seemed to be busy and did
nothing. So the elephants went home. They
had struck, and declined working but of business
hours: Next morning, on the way to work, one
elephant was again brought, and pushed the rudder
down into the water, almost as a man might
push a walking-stick.</p>

<p>Stories illustrative of the kindness, gratitude,
and kindred feelings of which animals are capable,
have no end; one follows on another; for in
fact, the animals, bird, beast, and fish, are all
good fellows, if you come to know them properly.
A rat tamed by a prisoner at Genf slept in his
bosom. Punished for some fault, it ran away,
but its anger or its fear died and its love lived on:
in a month it returned. The prisoner was released,
and in the joy of liberty it did not come into
his mind to take his old companion with him.
The rat coiled itself up in some old clothes left
by his friend, all that was left of him, abstained
from food, and died in three days.</p>

<p>A surgeon at Dover saw in the streets a wounded
terrier, and like a true man took it home with
him, cured it in two days, and let it go. The
terrier ran home, resolved to pay the doctor by
installments. For many succeeding weeks he paid
a daily visit to the surgery, wagged his tail violently
for some minutes and departed. Tailwagging
is dog's money, and when this dog
thought that he had paid in his own coin a proper
doctor's bill, the daily visit to the surgery was
discontinued.</p>

<h2>AN EPISODE OF THE ITALIAN REVOLUTION.</h2>


<p>During my residence at London in the early
part of 1848, I became acquainted with Count &mdash;&mdash; and
his friend Del Uomo, both Italians. They
had settled at London about two years previously,
and were remarkable for the strength of attachment
subsisting between them. I believe it
was four years since they had left Lombardy, and
they had clung together in exile closer than
brothers. Del Uomo was several years the senior.
His age might be about thirty; and a nobler
looking Italian I never met with. There was a
majesty in his fine manly form, and a dignity in
his bearing, that impressed every body at first
sight. His countenance was peculiarly handsome,
yet shaded with an expression of habitual
melancholy. His piercing black eyes, and long
black hair, and flowing beard, added to the interest
of his aspect. His influence over his young
companion was most extraordinary. Count &mdash;&mdash; regarded
him as friend, brother, father. Whatever
Del Uomo did or said was right in his eyes;
and yet on the vital subject of religion the two
were diametrically opposed.</p>

<p>At the time in question, Italy was in a flame
of war, and refugee Italians were hurrying from
all parts of the world to fight in what they deemed
a righteous cause. For reasons not necessary
to be named, Count &mdash;&mdash; could not himself join
his fellow-patriots; but his pen and his purse
were devoted to the cause. Del Uomo, however,
at once prepared to leave for the seat of war. "I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_772" id="Page_772">[Pg 772]</a></span>
have a father, mother, and sisters," said he, "who
are exposed to all the horrors of war, and for
them, as well as for my poor bleeding country,
my sword must be drawn." His friend was almost
heartbroken to part with him, but there was
no alternative. Well do I remember the morning
when Del Uomo left London. Numbers of Italians
assembled to bid him farewell, and the parting
scene was deeply affecting. When I myself
wrung his hand, and bade God speed him, I felt
the subtle involuntary presentiment that he would
be shot, and mentioned it to my friends at the
time. Little, however, did I think in what manner
he would meet his end.</p>

<p>Many months rolled on, with varying success
to the arms of Italy. I frequently heard tidings
of Del Uomo from his friend. The gallant fellow
had obtained a commission in a regiment of cavalry,
and was said to have distinguished himself
in every action. Ere the close of the campaign,
his regiment was almost annihilated, but he himself
escaped, I believe, without a wound. Austria
triumphed, and Italy was bound in chains
heavier than ever.</p>

<p>One morning, Count &mdash;&mdash; received a parcel of
letters from Italy, the perusal of which threw
him into a state of distraction. It was two or
three days ere I learned their full import&mdash;detailing
the following intelligence of the betrayal of
Del Uomo to his enemies, and his cruel death.</p>

<p>The parents and family of Del Uomo remained
in Lombardy&mdash;he himself being in security in
some other part of Italy. He was seized with an
intense desire to see them once more, and at all
hazards determined to indulge in this natural
yearning. He had fought openly and manfully
against the Austrians, and, however merciless
they might be, he did not think they would have
sufficient colorable excuse to put him to death,
even if he were recognized and seized. Probably
he was correct in this, but he had not reckoned
on the depths of perfidy to which they would descend.</p>

<p>Hardly had he set foot in the Lombard territory,
ere he was recognized by a creature of
Austria, who instantly planned his destruction.
Accosting Del Uomo, this spy inquired whether
he were not about to visit such a town? (I believe,
the very town where his parents dwelt.)
The unsuspicious fellow replied in the affirmative.
"Then," said the other, "would you do
me the favor to deliver this letter to a friend of
mine, there resident? I have no other opportunity
to send it, and shall be infinitely obliged."
Del Uomo, with his usual kindliness of disposition,
instantly consented, and put the letter into
his pocket, without even looking at the superscription.
From that moment his doom was
sealed, and he went as a victim to the slaughter.</p>

<p>No sooner had he embraced his family than the
bloodhounds of Austria were on his track, and to
his amazement, he was seized, and accused of
being engaged in a traitorous design. He indignantly
denied it. "I fought in open battle against
you, man to man, sword to sword," replied he;
"but the war is over, and never since have I
done aught against Austria." He was searched,
and the letter given him to deliver found in his
pocket. It was opened, and proved to be a treasonable
correspondence addressed to one known
as a conspirator. Vain all explanation of the
manner in which it came into his possession&mdash;vain
all the frantic prayers for mercy by his
agonized family. The ruthless Austrians only
required a fair-seeming pretext to put so distinguished
an enemy to death, and here it was.
Whether the general in command did or did not
believe Del Uomo guilty, admits of some doubt;
but that mattered not, so far as his doom was
concerned. Little respite&mdash;no mercy. He was
condemned to be shot on the spot. The priest, his
confessor, was so satisfied of his innocency, that
he even knelt to the Austrian general, imploring
pardon, or at least a respite till the truth could
be investigated; but the general only answered,
"He dies!"</p>

<p>Del Uomo behaved like a Christian and a hero.
He prayed fervently to God to receive his soul.
Death he feared not in itself, but the bitterness
of such a death as this to his poor family was indeed
an awful trial. He was led out to the fatal
spot, and there he embraced his relatives for the
last time. He gave his watch to his father, his
handkerchief to a sister, and bequeathed other little
mementoes to his friends. His poor mother
swooned away, but his father and one or two sisters
stood by him till all was over. They offered
to bind his eyes, but he refused. "No," said
he, "I am not afraid to look upon death. I will
enter eternity with open eyes." And he looked
his farewell at his friends, at the glorious orb of
day, at the landscape, at the soil of Italy, so soon
to be watered with his blood; then he drew himself
to his full height, bared his breast, and, with
flashing eyes, cried, "Fire, soldiers! Long live
Italy!" Nine balls pierced him, and he ceased
to breathe. Peace to the memory of Del Uomo!</p>

<h2>TWO KINDS OF HONESTY.</h2>


<p>Some few years ago, there resided in Long
Acre an eccentric old Jew, named Jacob
Benjamin: he kept a seed shop, in which he
likewise carried on&mdash;not a common thing, we
believe, in London&mdash;the sale of meal, and had
risen from the lowest dregs of poverty, by industry
and self-denial, till he grew to be an affluent
tradesman. He was, indeed, a rich man; for as
he had neither wife nor child to spend his money,
nor kith nor kin to borrow it of him, he had a
great deal more than he knew what to do with.
Lavish it on himself he could not, for his early
habits stuck to him, and his wants were few.
He was always clean and decent in his dress,
but he had no taste for elegance or splendor in
any form, nor had even the pleasures of the table
any charms for him; so that, though he was no
miser, his money kept on accumulating, while it
occurred to him now and then to wonder what
he should do with it hereafter. One would think
he need not have wondered long, when there
were so many people suffering from the want of
what he abounded in; but Mr. Benjamin, honest
man, had his crotchets like other folks. In the
first place, he had less sympathy with poverty
than might have been expected, considering how
poor he had once been himself; but he had a
theory, just in the main, though by no means
without its exceptions&mdash;that the indigent have
generally themselves to thank for their privations.
Judging from his own experience, he believed
that there was bread for every body that would
take the trouble of earning it; and as he had
had little difficulty in resisting temptation himself,
and was not philosopher enough to allow for
the varieties of human character, he had small
compassion for those who injured their prospects
by yielding to it. Then he had found, on more
than one occasion, that even to the apparently
well-doing, assistance was not always serviceable.
Endeavor was relaxed, and gratuities, once
received, were looked for again. Doubtless, part
of this evil result was to be sought in Mr. Benjamin's
own defective mode of proceeding; but
I repeat, he was no philosopher, and in matters
of this sort he did not see much farther than his
nose, which was, however, a very long one.</p>

<p>To public charities he sometimes subscribed
liberally; but his hand was frequently withheld
by a doubt regarding the judicious expenditure
of the funds, and this doubt was especially fortified
after chancing to see one day, as he was
passing the Crown and Anchor Tavern, a concourse
of gentlemen turn out, with very flushed
faces, who had been dining together for the
benefit of some savages in the Southern Pacific
Ocean, accused of devouring human flesh&mdash;a
practice so abhorrent to Mr. Benjamin, that he
had subscribed for their conversion. But failing
to perceive the connection betwixt the dinner
and that desirable consummation, his name appeared
henceforth less frequently in printed lists,
and he felt more uncertain than before as to what
branch of unknown posterity he should bequeath
his fortune.</p>

<p>In the mean time, he kept on the even tenor
of his way, standing behind his counter, and
serving his customers, assisted by a young
woman called Leah Leet, who acted as his shop-woman,
and in whom, on the whole, he felt more
interest than in any body else in the world, insomuch
that it even sometimes glanced across
his mind, whether he should not make her the
heiress of all his wealth. He never, however,
gave her the least reason to expect such a thing,
being himself incapable of conceiving that, if he
entertained the notion, he ought to prepare her
by education for the good fortune that awaited
her. But he neither perceived this necessity,
nor, if he had, would he have liked to lose the
services of a person he had been so long accustomed
to.</p>

<p>At length, one day a new idea struck him. He
had been reading the story of his namesake, Benjamin,
in the Old Testament, and the question
occurred to him, how many among his purchasers
of the poorer class&mdash;and all who came to his shop
personally were of that class&mdash;would bring back
a piece of money they might find among their
meal, and he thought he should like to try a few
of them that were his regular customers. The
experiment would amuse his mind, and the money
he might lose by it he did not care for. So he
began with shillings, slipping one among the
flour before he handed it to the purchaser. But
the shillings never came back&mdash;perhaps people
did not think so small a sum worth returning;
so he went on to half-crowns and crowns, and
now and then, in very particular cases, he even
ventured a guinea; but it was always with the
same luck, and the longer he tried, the more he
distrusted there being any honesty in the world,
and the more disposed he felt to leave all his
money to Leah Leet, who had lived with him so
long, and to his belief, had never wronged him
of a penny.</p>

<p>"What's this you have put into the gruel,
Mary?" said a pale, sickly-looking man, one
evening, taking something out of his mouth,
which he held toward the feeble gleams emitted
by a farthing rush-light standing on the mantle-piece.</p>

<p>"What is it, father?" inquired a young girl,
approaching him. "Isn't the gruel good?"</p>

<p>"It's good enough," replied the man; "but
here's something in it: it's a shilling, I believe."</p>

<p>"It's a guinea, I declare!" exclaimed the girl,
as she took the coin from him and examined it
nearer the light.</p>

<p>"A guinea!" repeated the man; "well, that's
the first bit of luck I've had these seven years or
more. It never could have come when we wanted
it worse. Show it us here, Mary."</p>

<p>"But it's not ours, father," said Mary. "I
paid away the last shilling we had for the meal,
and here's the change."</p>

<p>"God has sent it us, girl! He saw our distress,
and He sent it us in His mercy!" said the
man, grasping the piece of gold with his thin,
bony fingers.</p>

<p>"It must be Mr. Benjamin's," returned she.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_774" id="Page_774">[Pg 774]</a></span>
"He must have dropped it into the meal-tub that
stands by the counter."</p>

<p>"How do you know that?" inquired the man
with an impatient tone and a half-angry glance.
"How can you tell how it came into the gruel?
Perhaps it was lying at the bottom of the basin,
or at the bottom of the sauce-pan. Most likely
it was."</p>

<p>"Oh, no, father," said Mary: "it is long since
we had a guinea."</p>

<p>"A guinea that we knew of; but I've had
plenty in my time, and how do you know this is
not one we had overlooked?"</p>

<p>"We've wanted a guinea too much to overlook
one," answered she. "But never mind, father;
eat your gruel, and don't think of it: your cheeks
are getting quite red with talking so, and you
won't be able to sleep when you go to bed."</p>

<p>"I don't expect to sleep," said the man, peevishly;
"I never do sleep."</p>

<p>"I think you will, after that nice gruel!" said
Mary, throwing her arms round his neck, and
tenderly kissing his cheek.</p>

<p>"And a guinea in it to give it a relish, too!"
returned the father, with a faint smile and an expression
of archness, betokening an inner nature
very different from the exterior which sorrow and
poverty had encrusted on it.</p>

<p>His daughter then proposed that he should go
to bed; and having assisted him to undress, and
arranged her little household matters, she retired
behind a tattered, drab-colored curtain which
shaded her own mattress, and laid herself down
to rest.</p>

<p>The apartment in which this little scene occurred,
was in the attic story of a mean house,
situated in one of the narrow courts or alleys
betwixt the Strand and Drury-lane. The furniture
it contained was of the poorest description;
the cracked window-panes were coated with dust;
and the scanty fire in the grate, although the
evening was cold enough to make a large one
desirable&mdash;all combined to testify to the poverty
of the inhabitants. It was a sorry retreat for
declining years and sickness, and a sad and
cheerless home for the fresh cheek and glad
hopes of youth; and all the worse, that neither
father nor daughter was "to the manner born;"
for poor John Glegg had, as he said, had plenty
of guineas in his time; at least, what should
have been plenty, had they been wisely husbanded.
But John, to describe the thing as he
saw it himself, had always "had luck against
him." It did not signify what he undertook, his
undertakings invariably turned out ill.</p>

<p>He was born in Scotland, and had passed a
great portion of his life there; but, unfortunately
for him, he had no Scotch blood in his veins, or
he might have been blessed with some small
modicum of the caution for which that nation is
said to be distinguished. His father had been a
cooper, and when quite a young man, John had
succeeded to a well-established business in Aberdeen.
His principal commerce consisted in furnishing
the retail-dealers with casks, wherein to
pack their dried fish; but partly from good-nature,
and partly from indolence, he allowed them to
run such long accounts, that they were apt to
overlook the debt altogether in their calculations,
and to take refuge in bankruptcy when the demand
was pressed and the supply of goods withheld&mdash;his
negligence thus proving, in its results,
as injurious to them as to himself. Five hundred
pounds embarked in a scheme projected by a too
sanguine friend, for establishing a local newspaper,
which "died ere it was born;" and a fire,
occurring at a time that John had omitted to renew
his insurance, had seriously damaged his
resources, when some matter of business having
taken him to the Isle of Man, he was agreeably
surprised to find that his branch of trade, which
had of late years been alarmingly declining in
Aberdeen, was there in the most flourishing condition.
Delighted with the prospect this state
of affairs opened, and eager to quit the spot
where misfortune had so unrelentingly pursued
him, John, having first secured a house at Ramsay,
returned to fetch his wife, children, and
merchandise, to this new home. Having freighted
a small vessel for their conveyance, he expected
to be deposited at his own door; but he had unhappily
forgotten to ascertain the character of
the captain, who, under pretense that, if he entered
the harbor, he should probably be wind-bound
for several weeks, persuaded them to go
ashore in a small boat, promising to lie-to till
they had landed their goods; but the boat had
no sooner returned to the ship, than, spreading
his sails to the wind, he was soon out of sight,
leaving John and his family on the beach, with&mdash;to
recur to his own phraseology&mdash;"nothing
but what they stood up in."</p>

<p>Having with some difficulty found shelter for
the night, they proceeded on the following morning
in a boat to Ramsay; but here it was found
that, owing to some informality, the people who
had possession of the house refused to give it up,
and the wanderers were obliged to take refuge
in an inn. The next thing was to pursue, and
recover the lost goods; but some weeks elapsed
before an opportunity of doing so could be found;
and at length, when John did reach Liverpool,
the captain had left it, carrying away with him
a considerable share of the property. With the
remainder, John, after many expenses and delays,
returned to the island, and resumed his
business. But he soon discovered to his cost,
that the calculations he had made were quite
fallacious, owing to his having neglected to inquire
whether the late prosperous season had
been a normal or an exceptional one. Unfortunately,
it was the latter; and several very unfavorable
ones that succeeded reduced the family
to great distress, and finally to utter ruin.</p>

<p>Relinquishing his shop and his goods to his
creditors, John Glegg, heart-sick and weary,
sought a refuge in London&mdash;a proceeding to
which he was urged by no prudential motives,
but rather by the desire to fly as far as possible
from the scenes of his vexations and disappointments,
and because he had heard that the metropolis
was a place in which a man might conceal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_775" id="Page_775">[Pg 775]</a></span>
his poverty, and suffer and starve at his ease,
untroubled by impertinent curiosity or officious
benevolence; and, above all, believing it to be
the spot where he was least likely to fall in with
any of his former acquaintance.</p>

<p>But here a new calamity awaited him, worse
than all the rest. A fever broke out in the
closely-populated neighborhood in which they
had fixed their abode, and first two of his three
children took it, and died; and then himself and
his wife&mdash;rendered meet subjects for infection by
anxiety of mind and poor living&mdash;were attacked
with the disease. He recovered; at least he survived,
though with an enfeebled constitution, but
he lost his wife, a wise and patient woman, who
had been his comforter and sustainer through all
his misfortunes&mdash;misfortunes which, after vainly
endeavoring to avert, she supported with heroic
and uncomplaining fortitude; but dying, she left
him a precious legacy in Mary, who, with a fine
nature, and the benefit of her mother's precept
and example, had been to him ever since a treasure
of filial duty and tenderness.</p>

<p>A faint light dawned through the dirty window
on the morning succeeding the little event with
which we opened our story, when Mary rose
softly from her humble couch, and stepping lightly
to where her father's clothes lay on a chair, at
the foot of his bed, she put her hand into his
waistcoat-pocket, and, extracting therefrom the
guinea which had been found in the gruel the
preceding evening, she transferred it to her own.
She then dressed herself, and having ascertained
that her father still slept, she quietly left the
room. The hour was yet so early, and the streets
so deserted, that Mary almost trembled to find
herself in them alone; but she was anxious to
do what she considered her duty without the
pain of contention. John Glegg was naturally
an honest and well-intentioned man, but the
weakness that had blasted his life adhered to him
still. They were doubtless in terrible need of the
guinea, and since it was not by any means certain
that the real owner would be found, he saw
no great harm in appropriating it; but Mary
wasted no casuistry on the matter. That the
money was not legitimately theirs, and that they
had no right to retain it, was all she saw; and
so seeing, she acted unhesitatingly on her convictions.</p>

<p>She had bought the meal at Mr. Benjamin's,
because her father complained of the quality of
that she procured in the smaller shops, and on
this occasion he had served her himself. From
the earliness of the hour, however, though the
shop was open, he was not in it when she arrived
on her errand of restitution; but addressing Leah
Leet, who was dusting the counter, she mentioned
the circumstance, and tendered the guinea; which
the other took and dropped into the till, without
acknowledgment or remark. Now Mary had not
restored the money with any view to praise or
reward: the thought of either had not occurred
to her; but she was, nevertheless, pained by the
dry, cold, thankless manner with which the restitution
was accepted, and she felt that a little
civility would not have been out of place on such
an occasion.</p>

<p>She was thinking of this on her way back,
when she observed Mr. Benjamin on the opposite
side of the street. The fact was, that he
did not sleep at the shop, but in one of the suburbs
of the metropolis, and he was now proceeding
from his residence to Long Acre. When
he caught her eye, he was standing still on the
pavement, and looking, as it appeared, at her, so
she dropped him a courtesy, and walked forward;
while the old man said to himself:
"That's the girl that got the guinea in her meal
yesterday. I wonder if she has been to return
it!"</p>

<p>It was Mary's pure, innocent, but dejected
countenance, that had induced him to make her
the subject of one of his most costly experiments.
He thought if there was such a thing as honesty
in the world, that it would find a fit refuge in
that young bosom; and the early hour, and the
direction in which she was coming, led him to
hope that he might sing <i>Eureka</i> at last. When
he entered the shop, Leah stood behind the
counter, as usual, looking very staid and demure;
but all she said was, "Good-morning;"
and when he inquired if any body had been there,
she quietly answered: "No; nobody."</p>

<p>Mr. Benjamin was confirmed in his axiom;
but he consoled himself with the idea, that as
the girl was doubtless very poor, the guinea
might be of some use to her. In the mean time,
Mary was boiling the gruel for her father's breakfast,
the only food she could afford him, till she
got a few shillings that were owing to her for
needle-work.</p>

<p>"Well, father, dear, how are you this morning?"</p>

<p>"I scarce know, Mary. I've been dreaming,
and it was so like reality, that I can hardly believe
yet it was a dream;" and his eyes wandered
over the room, as if looking for something.</p>

<p>"What is it, father? Do you want your
breakfast? It will be ready in five minutes."</p>

<p>"I've been dreaming of a roast fowl and a
glass of Scotch ale, Mary. I thought you came
in with the fowl, and a bottle in your hand, and
said: 'See, father, this is what I've bought with
the guinea we found in the meal!'"</p>

<p>"But I couldn't do that, father, you know.
It wouldn't have been honest to spend other
people's money."</p>

<p>"Nonsense!" answered John. "Whose money
is it, I should like to know? What belongs
to no one, we may as well claim as any body
else."</p>

<p>"But it must belong to somebody; and, as I
knew it was not ours, I've carried it back to Mr.
Benjamin."</p>

<p>"You have?" said Glegg, sitting up in bed.</p>

<p>"Yes, I have, father. Don't be angry. I'm
sure you won't when you think better of it."</p>

<p>But John <i>was</i> very angry indeed. He was
dreadfully disappointed at losing the delicacies
that his sick appetite hungered for, and which,
he fancied, would do more to restore him than all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_776" id="Page_776">[Pg 776]</a></span>
the <i>doctors' stuff</i> in London; and, so far, he was
perhaps right. He bitterly reproached Mary for
want of sympathy with his sufferings, and was
peevish and cross all day. At night, however,
his better nature regained the ascendant; and
when he saw the poor girl wipe the tears from
her eyes, as her nimble needle flew through the
seams of a shirt she was making for a cheap
warehouse in the Strand, his heart relented,
and, holding out his hand, he drew her fondly
toward him.</p>

<p>"You're right, Mary," he said, "and I'm
wrong; but I'm not myself with this long illness,
and I often think if I had good food I should get
well, and be able to do something for myself. It
falls hard upon you, my girl: and often when I
see you slaving to support my useless life, I wish
I was dead and out of the way; and then you
could do very well for yourself, and I think that
pretty face of yours would get you a husband
perhaps." And Mary flung her arms about his
neck, and told him how willing she was to work
for him, and how forlorn she should be without
him, and desired she might never hear any more
of such wicked wishes. Still, she had an ardent
desire to give him the fowl and the ale he had
longed for, for his next Sunday's dinner; but,
alas!&mdash;she could not compass it. But on that
very Sunday, the one that succeeded these little
events, Leah Leet appeared with a smart new
bonnet and gown, at a tea-party given by Mr.
Benjamin to three or four of his intimate friends.
He was in the habit of giving such small inexpensive
entertainments, and he made it a point
to invite Leah; partly because she made the tea
for him, and partly because he wished to keep
her out of other society, lest she should get married
and leave him&mdash;a thing he much deprecated
on all accounts. She was accustomed to his
business, he was accustomed to her, and, above
all, she was so honest!</p>

<p>But there are various kinds of honesty. Mary
Glegg's was of the pure sort; it was such as
nature and her mother had instilled into her; it
was the honesty of high principle. But Leah
was honest, because she had been taught that
honesty is the best policy; and as she had her
living to earn, it was extremely necessary that
she should be guided by the axiom, or she might
come to poverty and want bread, like others she
saw, who lost good situations from failing in this
particular.</p>

<p>Now, after all, this is but a sandy foundation
for honesty; because a person who is not actuated
by a higher motive, will naturally have no
objection to a little peculation in a safe way&mdash;that
is, when they think there is no possible
chance of being found out. In short, such honesty
is but a counterfeit, and, like all counterfeits,
it will not stand the wear and tear of the
genuine article. Such, however, was Leah's,
who had been bred up by worldly-wise teachers,
who neither taught nor knew any better. Entirely
ignorant of Mr. Benjamin's eccentric method
of seeking what, two thousand years ago, Diogenes
thought it worth while to look for with a
lantern, she considered that the guinea brought
back by Mary was a waif, which might be appropriated
without the smallest danger of being
called to account for it. It had probably, she
thought, been dropped into the meal-tub by some
careless customer, who would not know how he
had lost it; and, even if it were her master's, he
must also be quite ignorant of the accident that
had placed it where it was found. The girl was
a stranger in the shop; she had never been there
till the day before, and might never be there
again; and, if she were, it was not likely she
would speak to Mr. Benjamin. So there could
be no risk, as far as she could see; and the
money came just apropos to purchase some new
attire that the change of season rendered desirable.</p>

<p>Many of us now alive can remember the beginning
of what is called the sanitary movement,
previous to which era, as nothing was said about
the wretched dwellings of the poor, nobody thought
of them, nor were the ill consequences of their
dirty, crowded rooms, and bad ventilation at all
appreciated. At length the idea struck somebody,
who wrote a pamphlet about it, which the
public did not read; but as the author sent it to
the newspaper editors, they borrowed the hint, and
took up the subject, the importance of which, by
slow degrees, penetrated the London mind. Now,
among the sources of wealth possessed by Mr.
Benjamin were a great many houses, which, by
having money at his command, he had bought
cheap from those who could not afford to wait;
and many of these were situated in squalid
neighborhoods, and were inhabited by miserably
poor people; but as these people did not fall under
his eye, he had never thought of them&mdash;he
had only thought of their rents, which he received
with more or less regularity through the
hands of his agent. The sums due, however,
were often deficient, for sometimes the tenants
were unable to pay them, because they were so sick
they could not work; and sometimes they died,
leaving nothing behind them to seize for their
debts. Mr. Benjamin had looked upon this evil
as irremediable; but when he heard of the sanitary
movement, it occurred to him, that if he did
something toward rendering his property more
eligible and wholesome, he might let his rooms
to a better class of tenants, and that greater certainty
of payment, together with a little higher
rent, would remunerate him for the expense of
the cleaning and repairs. The idea being agreeable
both to his love of gain and his benevolence,
he summoned his builder, and proposed that he
should accompany him over these tenements, in
order that they might agree as to what should be
done, and calculate the outlay; and the house
inhabited by Glegg and his daughter happening
to be one of them, the old gentleman, in the natural
course of events, found himself paying an
unexpected visit to the unconscious subject of
his last experiment; for the last it was, and so
it was likely to remain, though three months had
elapsed since he made it; but its ill success had
discouraged him. There was something about<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_777" id="Page_777">[Pg 777]</a></span>
Mary that so evidently distinguished her from
his usual customers; she looked so innocent, so
modest, and withal so pretty, that he thought
if he failed with her, he was not likely to succeed
with any body else.</p>

<p>"Who lives in the attics?" he inquired of Mr.
Harker, the builder, as they were ascending the
stairs.</p>

<p>"There's a widow, and her daughter, and son-in-law,
with three children, in the back-room,"
answered Mr. Harker. "I believe the women
go out charring, and the man's a bricklayer. In
the front, there's a man called Glegg and his
daughter. I fancy they're people that have been
better off at some time of their lives. He has
been a tradesman&mdash;a cooper, he tells me; but
things went badly with him; and since he came
here, his wife died of the fever, and he's been so
weakly ever since he had it, that he can earn
nothing. His daughter lives by her needle."</p>

<p>Mary was out; she had gone to take home
some work, in hopes of getting immediate payment
for it. A couple of shillings would purchase
them coal and food, and they were much
in need of both. John was sitting by the scanty
fire, with his daughter's shawl over his shoulders,
looking wan, wasted, and desponding,</p>

<p>"Mr. Benjamin, the landlord, Mr. Glegg,"
said Harker.</p>

<p>John knew they owed a little rent, and was
afraid they had come to demand it. "I'm sorry
my daughter's out, gentlemen," he said. "Will
you be pleased to take a chair."</p>

<p>"Mr. Benjamin is going round his property,"
said Harker. "He is proposing to make a few
repairs, and do a little painting and whitewashing,
to make the rooms more airy and comfortable."</p>

<p>"That will be a good thing, sir," answered
Glegg&mdash;"a very good thing; for I believe it is
the closeness of the place that makes us country
folks ill when we come to London. I'm sure
I've never had a day's health since I've lived
here."</p>

<p>"You've been very unlucky, indeed, Mr.
Glegg," said Harker. "But you know, if we
lay out money, we shall look for a return. We
must raise your rent."</p>

<p>"Ah, sir, I suppose so," answered John, with
a sigh; "and how we're to pay it, I don't know.
If I could only get well, I shouldn't mind; for
I'd rather break stones on the road, or sweep a
crossing, than see my poor girl slaving from
morning to night for such a pittance."</p>

<p>"If we were to throw down this partition, and
open another window here," said Harker to Mr.
Benjamin, "it would make a comfortable apartment
of it. There would be room, then, for a
bed in the recess."</p>

<p>Mr. Benjamin, however, was at that moment
engaged in the contemplation of an ill-painted
portrait of a girl, that was attached by a pin over
the chimney-piece. It was without a frame, for
the respectable gilt one that had formerly encircled
it, had been taken off, and sold to buy bread.
Nothing could be coarser than the execution of
the thing, but as is not unfrequently the case
with such productions, the likeness was striking;
and Mr. Benjamin, being now in the habit of
seeing Mary, who bought all the meal they used
at his shop, recognized it at once.</p>

<p>"That's your daughter, is it?" he said.</p>

<p>"Yes, sir; she's often at your place for meal;
and if it wasn't too great a liberty, I would ask
you, sir, if you thought you could help her to
some sort of employment that's better than sewing;
for it's a hard life, sir, in this close place
for a young creature that was brought up in the
free country air; not that Mary minds work, but
the worst is, there's so little to be got by the
needle, and it's such close confinement."</p>

<p>Mr. Benjamin's mind, during this address of
poor Glegg's, was running on his guinea. He
felt a distrust of her honesty&mdash;or rather of the
honesty of both father and daughter; and yet,
being far from a hard-hearted person, their evident
distress and the man's sickness disposed
him to make allowance for them. "They couldn't
know that the money belonged to me," thought
he; adding aloud: "Have you no friends here
in London?"</p>

<p>"No, sir, none. I was unfortunate in business
in the country, and came here hoping for
better luck; but sickness overtook us, and we've
never been able to do any good. But, Mary, my
daughter, doesn't want for education, sir; and a
more honest girl never lived!"</p>

<p>"Honest, is she?" said Mr. Benjamin, looking
Glegg in the face.</p>

<p>"I'll answer for her, sir," answered John, who
thought the old gentleman was going to assist
her to a situation. "You'll excuse me mentioning
it, sir; but perhaps it isn't every body, distressed
as we were, that would have carried
back that money she found in the meal: but
Mary <i>would</i> do it, even when I said perhaps it
wasn't yours, and that nobody might know
whose it was; which was very wrong of me, no
doubt; but one's mind gets weakened by illness
and want, and I couldn't help thinking of the
food it would buy us; but Mary wouldn't hear
of it. I'm sure you might trust Mary with untold
gold, sir; and it would be a real charity to
help her to a situation, if you knew of such a
thing."</p>

<p>Little deemed Leah that morning, as she handed
Mary her quart of meal and the change for
her hard-earned shilling, that she had spoiled
her own fortunes, and that she would, ere night,
be called upon to abdicate her stool behind the
counter in favor of that humble customer; and
yet so it was. Mr. Benjamin could not forgive
her dereliction from honesty; and the more he
had trusted her, the greater was the shock to
his confidence. Moreover, his short-sighted
views of human nature, and his incapacity for
comprehending its infinite shades and varieties,
caused him to extend his ill opinion further than
the delinquent merited. In spite of her protestations,
he could not believe that this was her first
misdemeanor; but concluded that, like many
other people in the world, she had only been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_778" id="Page_778">[Pg 778]</a></span>
reputed honest because she had not been found
out. Leah soon found herself in the very dilemma
she had deprecated, and the apprehension
of which had kept her so long practically honest&mdash;without
a situation, and with a damaged character.</p>

<p>As Mary understood book-keeping, the duties
of her new office were soon learned; and the
only evil attending it was, that she could not
take care of her father. But determined not to
lose her, Mr. Benjamin found means to reconcile
the difficulty by giving them a room behind the
shop, where they lived very comfortably, till
Glegg, recovering some portion of health, was
able to work a little at his trade.</p>

<p>In process of time, however, as infirmity began
to disable Mr. Benjamin for the daily walk from
his residence to his shop, he left the whole management
of the business to the father and daughter,
receiving every shilling of the profits, except the
moderate salaries he gave them, which were sufficient
to furnish them with all the necessaries
of life, though nothing beyond. But when the
old gentleman died, and his will was opened, it
was found that he had left every thing he possessed
to Mary Glegg; except one guinea, which,
without alleging any reason, he bequeathed to
Leah Leet.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2>A FORGOTTEN CELEBRITY.</h2>


<p>"Time and chance," as King Solomon says,
"happen to all;" and this is peculiarly the
case in the matter of fame and reputation. Many
who have done much, and have enjoyed a fine
prospect of a name that should survive them,
have scarcely earned an epitaph; while others,
by a mere accident, have rolled luxuriously down
to posterity, like a fly on the chariot-wheels of
another's reputation. "The historic muse" is a
very careless jade, and many names with which
she has undertaken to march down to latest times,
have been lost by the way, like the stones in the
legend that fell through the devil's apron when
he was carrying them to build one of his bridges.
The chiffonniers of literature pick up these histories
from time to time; sometimes they are valuable,
sometimes only curious. Mademoiselle
de Gournay's story is a curiosity.</p>

<p>Marie de Jars, Demoiselle de Gournay, was
born at Paris in 1566. She was of a noble and
ancient family; her father, at his death, left what
in those days was a handsome fortune; but Mademoiselle
de Gournay, his widow, had an unfortunate
mania for building, which devoured it.
When she took her place beside her husband in
his grave, she left little but mortgages behind
her.</p>

<p>Judging from the portraits prefixed to her
works, Marie de Jars must in her youth have
possessed some personal attractions, in spite of
her detractors: her figure was of middle height,
her face rather round than oval, but with a pleasing
expression, and adorned with a pair of large
black eyes and a pretty little mouth. Her own
account of herself, in a copy of verses, addressed
to her friend Mademoiselle de Ragny, is, that she
was of a very lively and obliging disposition.
That she was obliging and kind-hearted, many
circumstances of her life could prove; but for
liveliness, we are inclined to think that she flattered
herself: nothing can be further removed
from liveliness than her works&mdash;they are pompously
serious.</p>

<p>Her father died when she was very young,
leaving five children: two elder and two younger
than Marie. The eldest daughter married; the
son entered the army; and Marie, the eldest of
the remaining three, seems to have been left
pretty much to follow her own devices. From
her earliest years she had a passion for reading,
and showed a wonderful sagacity in the choice of
books: her favorites were Amyot, Ronsard, and
Montaigne; to these authors she afterward added
Racan. She was so faithfully exclusive in her
taste, that she never cared to read any others. It
was in 1580 that Montaigne published the two
first volumes of his Essays. Marie de Jars was
scarcely fourteen when they fell accidentally in
her way, and her admiration amounted to enthusiasm:
she sent a friend to tell Montaigne, who
was then in Paris, how much she admired him,
and the esteem in which she held his book. This
proceeding from so young a person, who was
moreover "fort demoiselle," flattered Montaigne
very sensibly. He went the very next day to pay
a visit to Mademoiselle de Gournay: her conversation
and enthusiasm won the heart of the philosopher.
In their first interview Montaigne offered
her the affection of a father for a daughter
and Mademoiselle de Gournay proudly assumed
the title of the adopted daughter of Montaigne;
and in a letter addressed to him, which is still to
be seen, she says, "that she feels as proud of that
title as she should be to be called the mother of
the Muses themselves." This friendship never
failed or diminished; it was the best thing Marie
ever achieved in this life, and is her chief claim
on the sympathy and interest of posterity. But
Marie de Jars became possessed by the demon of
wishing to become a distinguished woman on her
own account. To accomplish this, she set to
work to learn Greek and Latin, and though she
brought more zeal than method to her studies, she
worked with so much perseverance as to obtain
a good insight into both languages.</p>

<p>Montaigne, in the next edition of his Essays,
added the following passage to the seventeenth
chapter of the second book: "I have taken a delight
to publish in many places the hopes I have
of Marie de Gournay de Jars, my adopted daughter,
beloved by me with more than a paternal
love, and treasured up in my solitude and retirement
as one of the best parts of my own being.
I have no regard to any thing in this world but
to her. If a man may presage from her youth,
her soul will one day be capable of very great
things; and, among others, of that perfection of
friendship of which we do not read that any of
her sex could yet arrive at; the sincerity and
solidity of her manners are already sufficient for
it; her affection toward me more than superabundant,
and such as that there is nothing more<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_779" id="Page_779">[Pg 779]</a></span>
to be wished, if not that the apprehension she
has of my end from the five-and-fifty years I had
reached when she knew me, might not so much
afflict her.</p>

<p>"The judgment she made of my first Essays,
being a woman so young, and in this age, and
alone in her order, place, and the notable vehemence
with which she loved and desired me, upon
the sole esteem she had of me before ever she saw
my face, are things very worthy of consideration."</p>

<p>Any woman might justly have been proud of
such a tribute, and one feels to like Montaigne
himself all the better for it. In 1588 Montaigne
went with Mademoiselle de Gournay and her
mother to their ch&acirc;teau at Gournay-sur-Aronde,
and spent some time with them.</p>

<p>In the year following she published her first
book, calling it "Proumenoir de M. de Montaigne."
She dedicated it to him, and sent a copy
to him at Bordeaux, where he was then residing.
That must have been a very proud day for
Marie! This "Proumenoir" was not, as its title
might suggest, any account of Montaigne, or
relics of his conversation, but only a rambling
Arabian story, which if gracefully told by Marie
herself, might perhaps have been interesting during
the course of a walk, but which, set down
upon paper, is insipid to a degree, and of an interminable
length. Montaigne is answerable for
the sin of having encouraged her to write it, thus
adding to the weary array of books that nobody
is able to read.</p>

<p>At her mother's death, Mademoiselle de Gournay
did something much better: she took charge
of her younger brother and sister, and administered
the affairs of the family (which, as we have
said, Madame de Gournay had left in great embarrassment)
with so much discretion and judgment,
that she redeemed all the mortgages, paid
off all the debts, and was in possession of about
two thousand pounds in money.</p>

<p>Montaigne died in 1592, at Bordeaux. Enthusiastic
and devoted, Mademoiselle de Gournay
set off as soon as she was informed of it, and,
providing herself with passes, crossed almost the
whole kingdom of France alone, to visit his widow
and daughter, to console them as best she might&mdash;and
to weep with them the loss they had sustained.</p>

<p>Madame de Montaigne gave her the Essays,
enriched with notes in her husband's hand-writing,
in order that she might prepare a new and
complete edition of them. This was a labor of
love to Marie: she revised all the proofs, which
were executed with so much correctness, that she
is well entitled to call it, as she does, "le bon et
vieux exemplaire." It remains to this day the
principal edition as regards authenticity of text,
and one of the handsomest as regards typography.
It appeared in 1595 (Paris, Abel Langlier). Mademoiselle
de Gournay wrote a preface, which is
not without eloquence. She vigorously repels all
the objections that had been raised against the
work, and alludes to her adoption by Montaigne
with genuine feeling. We translate the passage:
"Reader, having the desire to make the best of
myself to thee, I adorn myself with the noble title
of this adoption. I have no other ornament, and
I have a good right to call him my true father,
from whom all that is good or noble in my soul
proceeds. The parent to whom I owe my being,
and whom my evil fortune snatched from me in
my infancy, was an excellent father, and a most
virtuous and clever man&mdash;and he would have felt
less jealousy in seeing the second to whom I gave
this title of father, than he would have felt pride
in seeing the manner of man he was." The good
lady's style is of the most intractable to render
into common language.</p>

<p>With Montaigne's death, the whole course of
Mademoiselle de Gournay's life seemed to be arrested.
Henceforth all her strength and enthusiasm
were expended in keeping herself exactly
where he had left her. She resolutely set her
face against all the improvements and innovations
which were every day being brought into the
French language, which was making rapid progress;
but Mademoiselle de Gournay believed
that she had seen the end of all perfection when
Montaigne died. Not only in her style of writing,
but also in her mode of living, she remained
obstinately stereotyped after the fashion of the
sixteenth century, during the first half of the
seventeenth. While still young, she became a
whimsical relic of a by-gone mode&mdash;a caricature
out of date. She resided in Paris, where there
was at that time a mania for playing practical
jokes; and Mademoiselle de Gournay, with her
pedantry and peculiarities, was considered as lawful
game; many unworthy tricks were played
upon her by persons who, nevertheless, dreaded
the explosions of her wrath on discovery, which
on such occasions were of an emphatic simplicity
of speech, startling to modern ears. The word
"hoaxing" was not then invented, but the thing
itself was well understood. A forged letter was
written, purporting to come from King James the
First of England, requesting Mademoiselle de
Gournay to send him her portrait and her life.
She fell into the snare, and sat for her picture,
and spent six weeks in writing her memoirs,
which she actually sent to England&mdash;where, of
course, no one knew what to make of them. But
when Marshal Lavardin, who was the French
embassador in England, returned to Paris, the
parties who forged the letter did not fail to tell
Mademoiselle de Gournay that the King of England
had spoken most highly of her to the embassador,
and had shown him her autograph,
which occupied a distinguished place in his cabinet.
As M. de Lavardin died almost directly
after his return, Mademoiselle de Gournay ran no
risk of being undeceived.</p>

<p>For a short time she abandoned literature and
the belles-lettres to plunge into alchemy, for
which she had a mania. Her friends remonstrated
in vain; they told her how many other
people alchemy had ruined, but she not the less
persisted in flinging the remains of her fortune
into the crucible. Like all who have been bewitched
by this science, Marie fancied that her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_780" id="Page_780">[Pg 780]</a></span>
experiments were arrested by poverty at the moment
of success. She retrenched in every way;
in food, in clothing; reduced herself to barest
necessaries; and sat constantly with the bellows
in her hand, hanging over the smoke of her furnace.
Of course, no gold rewarded her research,
and she was at length absolutely obliged to abandon
her laboratory, and betake herself afresh to
literature. As generous in adversity as she had
been in prosperity, Mademoiselle de Gournay
was not hindered by her poverty from adopting
an orphan child, the daughter of Jamyn, the
poet, and friend of Ronsard. In the society of
this young girl, and of a cat which she celebrated
in verse, Marie de Gournay allowed every thing
in the world to change and progress as they
might, fully persuaded that the glory of French
literature had died with her adopted father, and
that she had had the honor of burying it.</p>

<p>This cat deserves a special mention, as it was
a very noticeable animal in its day. It rejoiced
in the name of <i>Piallion</i>, and during the twelve
years it lived with Mademoiselle de Gournay, it
never once quitted the apartments of its mistress
to run with other cats upon the roofs and gutters
of the neighboring houses; it was, in all respects,
discreet and dignified, as became a cat of quality,
and above all, as became the cat of such a mistress
as Mademoiselle de Gournay. If Mademoiselle
de Gournay had been young and handsome,
<i>Piallion</i> would, no doubt, have been as
celebrated as Leslie's sparrow; as it was, however,
it only shared in the satires and caricatures
that were made upon its mistress. When Mademoiselle
de Gournay renounced alchemy, and
began again to busy herself in literature, she unfortunately
mixed herself up in some controversy
of the day where the Jesuits were in question;
we forget what side she took, but she brought
down upon herself much abuse and scandal;
among other things, she was accused of having
led an irregular life, and being even then, "<i>une
femme galante!</i>" This charge distressed her
greatly, and she appealed to a friend to write
her vindication. He told her by way of consolation,
that if she would publish her portrait, it
would be more effectual than a dozen vindications!
Poor Mademoiselle de Gournay had long
since lost whatever good looks she had possessed
in early life, and her alchemical pursuits had
added at least ten years to her appearance.</p>

<p>In the midst of all the disagreeable circumstances
of her lot, she was not without some
consolation. She kept up her relation with the
family of Montaigne, and went on a visit to them
in Guyenne, where she remained fifteen months.
In all her distress, Mademoiselle Montaigne and
her daughter, Mademoiselle de Gamaches, never
deserted her. There is a touching passage in
one of her works, in which the name of the
"bonne amye" is mentioned. There is little
doubt but that it refers to one of these ladies; it
is as follows:</p>

<p>"If my condition be somewhat better than
could have been expected, from the miserable
remnant of fortune that remained to me after the
quittance of all my debts, liabilities, and losses,
it is the assistance of a good friend, who took
pleasure to see me keep up a decent appearance,
which is the cause of it."</p>

<p>Mademoiselle de Gournay also brightened the
dull realities of her existence with brilliant ideas
of the fame she was laying up for herself with
posterity&mdash;hopes which neither Mademoiselle
Jamyn nor Piallion were likely to damp. In
1626, she published a collection of her works, in
prose and verse, which she entitled "L'Ombre
de Mademoiselle de Gournay," and sat in her
retirement expecting the rebound of the sensation
she had no doubt of producing throughout
Europe.</p>

<p>The book was written in imitation of Montaigne's
"Essays"&mdash;all manner of subjects treated
of, without any regard to order or arrangement;
long dissertations, rambling from topic to
topic in every chapter, without any rule but her
own caprice. It may be imagined what advantage
such a work would give to those disposed to
find matter for ridicule; the spirit of mystification
and love of hoaxing were not extinct. There
was a pitiless clique of idle men attached to the
Court, and circulating in society, who were always
on the watch for victims, at whose expense
they might make good stories, or whom they
might make the subjects of a practical jest.
Mademoiselle de Gournay had fallen into their
snares years before, and she seemed a still more
tempting victim now. A regular conspiracy of
wicked wits was formed against the poor old
woman, who was then not much under sixty
years of age. Her vanity had grown to enormous
magnitude; her credulity was in proportion;
while her power of swallowing and digesting
any flattery, however gross, was something
fabulous. No tribute that could be offered exceeded
her notion of her own deserts. She certainly
offered fair game for ridicule, and she was
not spared.</p>

<p>Louis the Thirteenth, who labored under the
royal malady of ennui, enjoyed the accounts of
the mystifications that were constantly put upon
the poor old lady.</p>

<p>They told her (and she believed them) that
there was nothing talked about at Court but her
book; and that his Majesty, Louis the Thirteenth,
was her warm admirer. Mademoiselle
de Gournay not unnaturally expected that some
solid proof of the royal admiration would follow;
but nothing came. Louis, well content to be
amused by absurd stories about her, never dreamed
of rewarding her for them. She was made to
believe that her portrait adorned the galleries of
Brussels and Antwerp; that in Holland her
works had been published with complimentary
prefaces; that, in Italy, C&aelig;sar Carpaccio and
Charles Pinto had celebrated her genius in their
own tongue, and spread the glory of her name
from one end of the peninsula to the other; and
that no well-educated person in Europe was ignorant
of her name and works. Marie de Gournay,
after having been adopted by Montaigne,
found all these marvels quite probable and easy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_781" id="Page_781">[Pg 781]</a></span>
of belief. These splendid visions of fame and
success were quite as good as reality; they gilded
her poverty, and invested her privations with a
dignity more than regal. Among many other
mystifications played off upon her, there was
one which has since, in different forms, made
the plot of farces and vaudevilles without number;
but it was for the behoof of Mademoiselle de
Gournay that it was originally made and invented.
The poet Racan, whose works were some
of the few Mademoiselle de Gournay condescended
to read, had received a copy of "L'Ombre,"
and prepared to pay her a visit to return thanks.
It must be borne in mind that they had never
seen each other; the conspirators chanced to
hear of his intentions. Such a fine occasion was
not to be neglected; having ascertained the time
appointed for the interview they took care to be
beforehand. The first who presented himself
was the Chevalier de Bresire; he caused himself
to be announced by Mademoiselle Jamyn
(the orphan she had adopted; now her friend
and companion), as M. Racan. He was clever
and agreeable, and flattered Mademoiselle de
Gournay with so much grace, that she was enchanted
with him. He had scarcely departed,
when M. Yvrande arrived: "Announce M. Racan,"
said he to Mademoiselle Jamyn.</p>

<p>"M. Racan has only this moment left us."</p>

<p>"Some vile trick!" said he, with indignation.</p>

<p>Mademoiselle de Gournay, seeing a young
man, still handsomer and more agreeable than
the other, and whose compliments were still
more poetical, was easily pacified, and received
him graciously. A few moments after he had
left, the poet himself made his appearance. He
was absent, nervous, shabbily dressed, awkward,
and had, moreover, a ridiculous pronunciation.
He called himself "<span class="smcap">Lacan</span>."</p>

<p>The old lady was now out of all patience.</p>

<p>"Must I, then, see nothing but <i>Racans</i> all the
days of my life!" she exclaimed, and taking off
her slipper, she flung it at his head, abusing him
vehemently for daring to impose upon her; and
drove him out of the house.</p>

<p>Of course this story was much too good not
to have a great success; it circulated not only
through the Court, but all over Paris, and came
at last to the ears of poor Mademoiselle de Gournay
herself, who could not be consoled, as it revealed
all the tricks to which she had been a
victim. The illusions thus rudely destroyed
were far more precious than the philosopher's
stone she had so vainly sought, and involved a
disappointment infinitely more painful. Who
can help sympathizing with the poor woman,
who thus saw all her fairy treasures resolved
into their intrinsic worthlessness?</p>

<p>However, good came out of evil. Cardinal
Richelieu&mdash;who had been especially delighted
with the story of the three Racans, and was
never weary of hearing it repeated&mdash;took the
fancy of wishing to see her that he might try to
make a good story out of her himself. He sent
for her, and indulged in some very clumsy pleasantry,
of which he had the grace to feel afterward
ashamed. Willing to make her some
amends, he settled a pension upon her, in order
that for the rest of her days, she, and her friend,
and her cat, might live on something better than
dry bread.</p>

<p>Under the influence of this gleam of sunshine,
Mademoiselle de Gournay edited another edition
of Montaigne's work, with an abridgment of her
former preface. She also published a fresh work
of her own, entitled, "Avis et Pr&eacute;sens de Mademoiselle
de Gournay," which had a moderate
success. Another edition of "L'Ombre" was
also called for. All this, in some measure, consoled
her for past humiliations.</p>

<p>Her prosperity lasted until the death of Cardinal
Richelieu. Mademoiselle de Gournay, then
in extreme old age, still survived him. When
the list of pensions granted by the Cardinal was
submitted to the king, her name caught his eye.
Louis the Thirteenth&mdash;who might have had some
grateful recollection of the many hearty laughs
his royalty had enjoyed at her expense&mdash;declared
that the Cardinal must have been mad
to grant such a woman a pension, and ordered
it to be suppressed! Mademoiselle de Gournay
passed the few remaining years of her life in a
state of poverty painful to reflect upon. She
died somewhere about 1646, at the age of eighty.</p>

<p>Poor as she was, she made her will as became
a person of her birth. She bequeathed her clothes
to Mademoiselle Jamyn, who, old and infirm,
survived her; a few books she left to different
friends; and a curious old Map of the World,
to the poet Gombauld&mdash;a personage as eccentric
as herself, and one who lived and died in still
greater penury, but who valued her legacy, and
transmitted it to his heirs as the most precious
treasure in the world.</p>

<h2>DILIGENCE IN DOING GOOD.</h2>


<p>Thomas Wright, of Manchester, is a worn
but not a weary man of sixty-three, who has
for forty-seven years been weekly servant in a
large iron foundry, of which he is now the foreman.
His daily work begins at five o'clock in
the morning, and closes at six in the evening;
for forty-seven years he has worked through
twelve hours daily, to support himself and those
depending on him. Those depending on him
are not few; he has had nineteen children; and
at some periods there have been grandchildren
looking to him for bread. His income never has
attained two hundred pounds a year. This is
a life of toil. Exeter Hall might plead for him
as a man taxed beyond the standard limit; but
he had bread to earn, and knew that he had
need to work for it: he did work with great zeal
and great efficiency, obtaining very high respect
and confidence from his employers. A man so
laboring, and leading in his home an exemplary,
pious life, might be entitled to go to bed betimes,
and rest in peace between these days of industry
and natural fatigue. What could a man do, in
the little leisure left by so much unremitting
work? Poor as he was&mdash;toiling as he did, a
modest man of humble origin, with no power<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_782" id="Page_782">[Pg 782]</a></span>
in the world to aid him but the wonderful spiritual
power of an earnest will&mdash;Thomas Wright
has found means, in his little intervals of leisure,
to lead back, with a gentle hand, three hundred
convicted criminals to virtue; to wipe the blot
from their names and the blight from their prospects;
to place them in honest homes, supported
by an honest livelihood.</p>

<p>Fourteen years ago Mr. Wright visited, one
Sunday, the New Bailey Prison, at Manchester,
and took an earnest interest in what he saw.
He knew that, with the stain of jail upon them,
the unhappy prisoners, after release, would seek
in vain for occupation; and that society would
shut the door of reformation on them, and compel
them, if they would not starve, to walk on
in the ways of crime. The jail-mark branding
them as dangerous, men buttoned up their pockets
when they pleaded for a second trial of their
honesty, and left them helpless. Then, Thomas
Wright resolved, in his own honest heart, that
he would visit in the prisons, and become a friend
to those who had no helper.</p>

<p>The chaplain of the New Bailey, Mr. Bagshawe,
recognized in the beginning the true
practical benevolence of the simple-minded visitor.
On his second visit a convict was pointed
out, on whom Mr. Wright might test his power.
It was certain power. From the vantage-ground
of a comparative equality of station, he pleaded
with his fellow workman for the wisdom of
a virtuous and honest life. Heaven does, and
Earth should, wipe out of account repented evil.
Words warm from the heart, backed with a deep
and contagious sense in the hearer of the high-minded
virtue shown by his companion, were
not uttered, like lip-sympathy, in vain. Then
Thomas Wright engaged to help his friend, to
get employment for him; and, if necessary, to
be surety with his own goods for his honorable
conduct. He fulfilled his pledge; and that man
has been ever since, a prosperous laborer, and an
upright member of society.</p>

<p>So the work began. So earnest, so humble;
yet, like other earnest, humble efforts, with a
blessing of prosperity upon it. In this way,
during the last fourteen years, by this one man,
working in the leisure of a twelve hours' daily
toil, hundreds have been restored to peace. He
has sent husbands repentant to their wives; he
has restored fathers to the fatherless. Without
incurring debt, supporting a large family on little
gains, he has contrived to spare out of his
little; contenting himself with a bare existence,
that he might have clothes to give and bits of
money, where they were required to reinstate an
outcast in society.</p>

<p>Mr. Wright is a dissenter&mdash;free, of course,
from bigotry; for bigotry can never co-exist with
charity so genuine. Although a dissenter working
spiritually in the prison, he never comes into
jarring contact with the chaplain. He makes a
point of kindling in his outcast friends a religious
feeling; but that is not sectarian; he speaks
only the largest sentiments of Christianity, and
asks only that they attend, once every week, a
place of worship, leaving them to choose what
church or chapel it may be. And, in the chapel
he himself attends, wherever his eye turns, he
can see decent families who stand by his means
there; men whom he has rescued from the vilest
courses, kneeling modestly beside their children
and their wives. Are not these families substantial
prayers?</p>

<p>Very humbly all this has been done. In behalf
of each outcast in turn, Mr. Wright has
pleaded with his own employer, or with others,
in a plain, manly way. Many now work under
himself, in his own place of occupation; his
word and guarantees having been sufficient recommendation.
Elsewhere, he has, when rebuffed,
persevered from place to place, offering
and laying down his own earnings as guarantee;
clothing and assisting the repentant unemployed
convict out of his own means, as far as possible;
speaking words, or writing letters, with a
patient zeal, to reconcile to him his honest relatives,
or to restore lost friends. Bare sustenance
for his own body by day, that he might screw
out of himself little funds in aid of his good
deeds&mdash;and four hours' sleep at night, after his
hard work, that he might screw out of his bed
more time for his devoted labor&mdash;these tell their
tale upon the body of the man, who still works
daily twelve hours for his family, and six or
eight hours for his race. He is now sixty-three
years old, and working forward on his course
worn, but unwearied.</p>

<p>No plaudits have been in his ear, and he has
sought none. Of his labor, the success was the
reward. Some ladies joined; and working quietly,
as he does, in an under-current of society,
after a while, he had from them the aid of a
small charitable fund, to draw upon occasionally
in the interest of the poor friends for whom he
struggled. Prison Inspectors found him out,
and praised him in reports. At first there were
a few words, and a note told of "this benevolent
individual. His simple, unostentatious, but earnest
and successful labors on behalf of discharged
prisoners are above all praise." After a few
years, the reports grew in their enthusiasm, and
strung together illustrations of the work that has
been done so quietly. Let us quote from this
source one or two examples:</p>

<p>"Five years ago I was," owns a certain G.J.,
"in the New Bailey, convicted of felony, and
sentenced to four months' imprisonment. When
I was discharged from prison, I could get no employment.
I went to my old employer, to ask
him to take me again. He said, I need not apply
to him, for if he could get me transported he
would; so I could get no work until I met with
Mr. Wright, who got me employed in a place,
where I remained some time, and have been in
employment ever since. I am now engaged as
a screw-cutter&mdash;a business I was obliged to learn&mdash;and
am earning nineteen shillings and twopence
a week. I have a wife and four children,
and but for Mr. Wright, I should have been a
lost man."</p>

<p>Others tell how they were saved by the timely<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_783" id="Page_783">[Pg 783]</a></span>
supplies of Mr. Wright's money, which "kept
their heads above water" till they obtained the
trust of an employer. Another, after telling his
career, adds: "I am now, consequently, in very
comfortable circumstances; I am more comfortable
now than ever I was in my life; I wish
every poor man was as comfortable as I am. I
am free from tippling, and cursing, and swearing;
have peace of mind, and no quarreling at
home as there used to be. I dare say I was as
wicked a man as any in Manchester. I thought
if I could once get settled under such a gentleman
as Mr. Wright, I would not abuse my opportunity,
and all I expected I have received.
I have got Bibles, hymn-book, prayer-book, and
tracts; and those things I never had in my house
since I have been married before. My wife is
delighted. My boy goes to school, and my girl
also."</p>

<p>Were the spirit of Mr. Wright diffused more
generally through society, the number of fallen
men&mdash;who, being restored with all due prudence
to a generous confidence, "would not abuse their
opportunity"&mdash;would tell decidedly on the statistics
of our criminal courts and prisons. To labor
as Mr. Wright has done, must be the prerogative
of few, though all the indolent may
note, by way of spur, how much a man, even
like Thomas Wright, poor, humble, scantily instructed,
may beget of good out of an earnest will.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2>THE NIGHT TRAIN.</h2>


<p>The curate and his daughter sat before the
fire. Both had been for some time silent, for
the father had fallen into that listless dreaminess
to which nothing is so conducive as gazing on
the glowing caverns in the coals, and pretty little
Faith cared not to disturb a rest that he was
not likely to be long suffered to enjoy unmolested.
And so the flamelets rose and sank, lighting their
thoughtful faces, and glittering on the gold-embossed
backs of the treasured volumes on
the shelves&mdash;the curate's most constant friends.
Twilight saddened into night. Up from behind
the gray church tower came the moon.
But still not a word broke the silence in the
parsonage parlor. The gaunt arms of the trees
waved drearily without. A streak of white
moonshine crept across the carpet like a silver
snake. Still he gazed fixedly on the bright pagoda
'mid the flame: it totters, but before it falls
we will track his wandering musings for a moment.
All men, he thinks, have as children gazed
on the burning coals, and fashioned castles,
figures, mountains in them, but though the elements
are all the same, no two men ever have
presented to them exactly the same position or
difficulty in life, and so only general rules of conduct
can be laid down; but yet&mdash;the minaret
crumbles to nothing, and changes to a strange
fantastic face, then into something like a funeral
plume; his dreams are all dispersed; the pensive
damsel looks up hurriedly, for high above the
muttering wind, fierce as the summons at the gates
of Cawdor, he hears a knocking loud and long.</p>

<p>It was a farmer's boy from the village. His
message was soon told. A poor man had been
seized with sudden illness at the wayside public-house,
and the clergyman's presence was required
immediately. He lingered to tell Faith not to
wait up for him, then rose without a murmur, and
prepared for his long dreary walk. A moment
after he was crossing the neatly-kept garden,
where the hydrangeas showed like piles of skulls
in the pale moonshine, and the chestnut leaves
were falling thick and fast. Then out into the
deep-rutted road, through miry lanes, across stark
scraps of common, and paths covered with fern
and marsh-mallow, till at last the glimmering candle
in the hostelry window came in sight, and he
stood under the creaking signboard of the White
Horse. The inn was of the humblest description,
and the room into which he was shown very
wretched indeed. The plaster had peeled off the
walls in great odd shapes, like the countries on a
map; the shutters had as many cracks as an ill-fitting
dissecting puzzle; the flooring was damp
and broken, there was a tracery of spiders' webs
about the bed-furniture, and the only sounds were
the groans of the occupant of the bed, and the
drowsy ticking of the death-watch. Thinking he
was asleep, the curate prepared to sit down and
wait for him to wake of himself, but the noise of
a drinking-song, shouted by some laborers in the
bar, startled him from his uneasy slumber, and
when Mr. F. next looked up, the ghastly face of
the sick man confronted his own&mdash;an eery nightmare
face, such as meets one in the outlines of
Retzsch, or peering out of the goblin scenes and
witches' caves of Peter Breughel. But if the face
was terrible, the voice that asked him "Why he
came!" and bade him take away the light that
glared and hurt his eyes, was more unearthly
still. But when he recognized him as the clergyman,
his manner altered. In a comparatively
tranquil state he listened to the minister's earnest
warnings and blessed consolations; then suddenly
the pain seized him; he screamed and groaned
awhile in wild delirium; a deep calm followed.
Raising himself in the bed, he drew a roll of torn
and discolored papers from under the pillow, and
put it into the curate's hand. His senses never
returned. A few more throbbings and struggles&mdash;a
wandering of the eyes about the room, first
to the ceiling, where the death-watch ticked on
drearily, then to the Arcadian scene on the tattered
patchwork counterpane&mdash;a clutching at the
bed-clothes&mdash;a shuddering&mdash;a film&mdash;and then&mdash;death!</p>

<p>The curate did not sleep that night until he
had read the stranger's diary to an end. It began
thus:</p>

<p>"<i>August 3d.</i>&mdash;Brian Marcliffe came to me
again; the same odd, mysterious air that I have
noticed so long. What can it mean? He can
not have found&mdash;But no, it's worse than useless
having dark forebodings. I shall soon be
able to put the sea between me and this cursed
golden inferno, Brazil, and with my darling Bertha
forget all these fears in the paradise of full purses&mdash;England.</p>

<p>"<i>August 4th.</i>&mdash;I met him by chance again,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_784" id="Page_784">[Pg 784]</a></span>
coming from the overseer's. Confound it, how
demon-like he looked! I will speak to him myself,
rather than be in suspense much longer. I
should then know the worst, at least.</p>

<p>"<i>August 5th.</i>&mdash;Ruin! The worst has come.
He does know all about my being behindhand in
my accounts, and hints&mdash;I can't write down
what. Bertha will never marry him but <i>as the
only chance of saving me from exposure</i>. Can he
be devil enough to propose it?</p>

<p>"<i>August 20th.</i>&mdash;Am I the same man I was a
month ago! Farewell forever, land of diamonds,
slaves, and late summers. Farewell lust of gold
and dread of disgrace. It is over, I hope, forever.
My Bertha&mdash;my own now&mdash;is sleeping like a lily
near me, and the only sound is the splashing of
the sea that is bearing me every moment further
from my fear. But stay; what have I left behind
me! What is there in that glen of mimosas?
A rotting corpse. What in men's mouths?
The name of murderer. Pray God it be not. Let
me think.</p>

<p>"On the Monday when I was leaving the office,
Brian came again, and asked me to go as far as
old Olivenza's coffee plantation. I said I would
come, and we set out an hour past sunset. It
was a beautiful evening; the skies as pure as
the robe of seraphim; the clouds like curls of incense,
now hiding, now revealing the dazzling
glory of the rising moon&mdash;all, save one black
streak right across her face, like a spread eagle.
Well, we had nearly got to the plantation before
Brian spoke; but I saw he was preparing something
by the villainous look of his eyes. He began:</p>

<p>"'So, Reuben Darke, you have considered my
proposition, and agree, of course?'</p>

<p>"I believe I professed ignorance of it; for, indeed,
he had never said any thing definite.</p>

<p>"'The consequences of opposition are as terrible
as they are inevitable,' said he, threateningly.</p>

<p>"'You can not stoop to such vileness&mdash;to
such wrong. You know that I am striving for a
great end&mdash;that I will make restitution full and
ample if I live to reach England.'</p>

<p>"This was the sense of what I said, but his
answer was clearly prepared long before he knew
what I should urge. It came gnashing through
his closed teeth like the hiss of an adder.</p>

<p>"'I must do my duty. It is my place to overlook
the accounts of all the clerks. You will show
me your books to-morrow.'</p>

<p>"He turned away. I prayed he might not
speak again, for his voice stirred up a feeling I
had never known before; but my bad angel, I
suppose, brought him back. I scarcely recollect
what he said. I have a vague notion of hearing
him mention Bertha's name with some cursed
plan that was to give her up to him forever, and
then he would, 'for the sake of old friendship,
deal as gently as he possibly could with me.'
Those words I remember well, and those were
the last he ever spoke to me. I dread to think
they were his last on earth. The feeling I
had wrestled against mastered me now. I could
restrain myself no longer, and struck at him with
a knife. He clutched my left hand in his teeth
like a tiger-cat. For a second we were grappling
together for life or death, but he had no chance
against me; and when I had breath to look at
him next, he was lying on his back, the hands
that he had tried to parry my blows with cut and
bleeding, and red stains on the broad mimosa
leaves around. Oh, God! what a reproach there
was in all the calm and silence of the night!
How the deep quiet of the sky spoke to my heart,
so troubled, dark, and guilty! As on the first
dread day by sin polluted, the voice of God in
Eden drove Adam forth abashed, so spoke the
still small voice of holy Nature with more than
earthquake tones to me, and straight I fled away.</p>

<p>"My Bertha does not know the whole. She
only knows that Brian had me in his power, owing
to some money transactions. If she did know
it, my conscience tells me she would not now be
sleeping here. There&mdash;all will be well in England.
Pray Heaven we get there safe. I will
go up on deck a few minutes. Writing it down
has brought the whole affair so fresh before me,
that it is useless trying to sleep in this fever. But
yet I am glad it is written.</p>

<p>"<i>October 15th.</i>&mdash;We entered the Channel this
afternoon. It is my wife's birthday; she took it
as a happy omen, and seemed so pleased with the
glitter and joyance of the busy river, that for a
whole hour&mdash;the first since I left Rio&mdash;the dreadful
secret hidden 'mid those leaves was absent
from my mind.</p>

<p>"<i>October 16th.</i>&mdash;The first news that meets me
on entering London is, that my uncle has died
suddenly, and left all his affairs frightfully embarrassed.
My chief dependence was on him.
This is a sad beginning; indeed, I feel that 'all
these things are against me.'"</p>

<p>Several pages were here torn from the unfortunate
Darke's manuscript; and in the succeeding
ones the entries were scanty, and with long
intervals between each other. They detailed the
sufferings of the writer and his wife on their arrival
in London; his repeated efforts to obtain
employment, and the difficulties he met with,
owing to his uncle's death, and his own inability
to refer any one to the directors of the mine at
Rio. For more than a year (judging from the
dates, by no means regularly affixed) he appeared
to have struggled on thus, until, when his hopes
were fast sinking, and his health rapidly giving
way under this succession of disappointments, he
obtained a situation on a recently-opened line of
railway in the north, through the interest of an
old schoolfellow, whom he accidentally met, and
who retained in manhood schoolboy heart enough
to show gratitude for many kindnesses in olden
days. The language was strangely impassioned
and earnest in which he expressed his joy at this
change of fortune; and the full-hearted thankfulness
with which he described telling his wife
the good news, seemed to prove that affliction
had exerted a calming and blessed influence on
his passion-tossed mind. But the clergyman
could not help noticing that the spirit pervading
the latter part of the diary was strangely different<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_785" id="Page_785">[Pg 785]</a></span>
from that which animated the commencement,
it being written apparently with the firm conviction
of an inevitable destiny hanging over the
writer; and this, like the shadow of an unseen
cloud in a fair picture, gave a sombre meaning to
his self-communings.</p>

<p>After briefly mentioning the fact of his taking
up his abode with Bertha and one little child at
the cottage provided by the company, and that he
had heard by chance that his enemy was still
alive, he proceeded:</p>

<p>"I like this new home much. It is a tiny,
sheltered cottage, with beehives in the garden,
and honeysuckles peeping in at the lattice, nestling
innocently among the pine-trees, like a fairy
islet. The railway runs for about a mile parallel
with the canal, and the two modes of traveling
contrast curiously. The former with all its
brightness, freshness, and precision; the latter
a very sluggard. I often have long talks with
Huntly, my assistant here, and try to make him
see the change it will work; but he is not over
shrewd; or, rather, fate did not give him a bookworm
uncle like it did me, and so reasoning is
hard work to him; it always is to the untaught.
The canal is picturesque certainly. Let me try
a description. The surface of the water is overlaid
with weeds rank and luxuriant, save where
the passage of a boat has preserved a trench,
stagnant, and cold, and deep. There is not a
human habitation near except ours. Scarcely
any paths, the thickets are so tangled. This
does not read an inviting account, I know, but
there is a charm to me in the leaves of myriad
shapes, in fern, and moss, and rush, in every
silvan nook and glittering hedgerow&mdash;above all,
in the dark slumberous pines, those giant sentinels
round our dear home. Bertha smiled quite
like her old self when she saw it. Oh, how, in
all the wreck of this last year, has her love upheld
me! always lightening, never adding to our
weight of grief. She has, indeed, been faithful,
true, and beautiful&mdash;like the Indian tree, that
has its flower and fragrance best by night. I
can not explain why it is that my love seems to
grow each hour, but with a kind of tremble in
its intensity, as though there were a separation
coming. Perhaps it is only the result of the
change in my fortunes.</p>

<p>"<i>March 10th.</i>&mdash;Two years ago I should have
laughed had any one told me that a dream would
give me a second thought, much less that I should
sit down to write what I remember of one; but
I must write down last night's, nevertheless. I
thought that it was a clear moonlight night,
and that I rose as usual to signal to the latest
luggage train. I had got to the accustomed
place, and stood waiting a long time. For days,
for months; I knew this, because the trees
were budding when I began my watch&mdash;were
bare as winter when, with a roar and quaking
all around, the night train came. At first I held
a lantern in my hand, to signal all was well.
Strange as it may appear, I felt no weariness,
for I was fixed as by a wizard's rod. It passed
at length; but not, thank God! as it has ever
passed before; for from the carriage window,
like a mask, glared Marcliffe's vengeful face. I
said I held a light; but, as the smoke and iron
hurtled by, the lamp was dashed to atoms, and
in my outstretched hand I grasped a knife!
There was a yell of demons in my ear, with
Brian's jeering laugh above it all. I moaned
awhile in horror, and woke to find my Bertha's
eyes on mine. She has been soothing and kind
as mercy to me all the day, and I, alas! wayward,
almost cruel. I saw it pained her, but I
could not help it. Oh, would that this world
had no concealments, no divisions, no estrangement
of hearts! I dread the night; there is
something tells me it will come again, for when
I took the Bible down to read, it opened at the
words:</p>

<p>"'I the Lord will make myself known unto
him in a vision, and will speak unto him in a
dream.'</p>

<p>"A thrill went through me as I read. It
sounded like a death-knell.</p>

<p>"<i>The next day.</i>&mdash;As I foresaw it came again
last night; the same in every terrible particular,
and with the same consolation on awaking. But
what I have seen to-day gives it a meaning that
I tremble at. Huntly returned from D&mdash;&mdash;. He
brought a birthday present for little Harry; it
happened to be wrapped in an old newspaper.
As it was opened, I saw <i>his</i> name, and a moment
after read this:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"'<span class="smcap">Next of Kin.</span>&mdash;If any child or children of
the late Ehud Marcliffe, Gentleman, of Cranholm
Manse, who died September 5, 18&mdash;, be yet surviving,
it is desired that he or they will forthwith
put themselves in communication with Messrs.
Faulk and Lockerby, Solicitors, D&mdash;&mdash;.'</p></blockquote>

<p>"This leaves me no hope; and knowing, as
I do, the unfaltering steadfastness of his hate I
feel the days of this security and peace are
numbered....</p>

<p>"A whole month has gone since I opened this
last. There is no fear now. He is dead. But
how? The eye that reads this record alone will
know. That fatal Thursday went by, a phantasm
of dark thoughts; and then I lay down, as
usual, for a couple of hours before going to
watch. I did this, for there was a kind of instinct
in me (the feeling deserves no higher
name) which made me go about my avocations in
the accustomed way, and seem as little disturbed
as possible. I lay down, and in my dream, as
distinct as ever it passed by day, for the third
time that awful freight swept like a whirlwind
by. I awoke. It wanted only three minutes to
the hour when the night-train usually passed.
I staggered to the door, but, instead of coming
out into the light, an inky shadow lay across the
road. It was a car left by Huntly's carelessness
on the up-rail. I stood like one of stone, thinking
of the tranquil happiness of the last months,
of Bertha's smile, and Harry's baby laugh&mdash;of
all the sun and pleasure of our home, and how
this precious fabric, wove by love, was to be rent
and torn; and how one word from him would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_786" id="Page_786">[Pg 786]</a></span>
ruin all, and send my wife and child to poverty
again. And that man's life was in my hand.
Well may we daily pray against temptation.</p>

<p>"A white cloud curled up above the pines.</p>

<p>"There was no delay. I caught up the lantern,
and ran down the line. A throbbing, like
the workings of a giant's pulse, smote my ear.
I reached the signal-post, and laid my hand upon
the bell. But there was no time for thought.</p>

<p>"The murmur deepened to a roar. The clouds
of steam rose high above the pines, and, girt
about with wreathing vapor, the iron outline,
with its blood-red lamps and Hecla glow beneath,
came on.</p>

<p>"My eyes were strangely keen, for at that
distance I could discern a man leaning out of
the nearest window. I knew who it must be,
and almost expecting to see the last dreadful
particular fulfilled, held out my hand&mdash;<i>the sign
that all was safe</i>. The driver signaled that he
understood, and quickened pace. I shut my
eyes when it drew near, but, as it passed, distinctly
heard my name called thrice.</p>

<p>"There was a moment that seemed never-ending.
Then a clatter as of a hundred anvil
strokes, a rush of snow-white steam, a shower
of red-hot ashes scattered far, the hum of voices,
and the clanging of the bell. Then, and not till
then, I ventured to look up and hurry to the spot.
The train, a series of shapeless wrecks, luggage-vans,
trucks, carriages in wild confusion, lay
across the road; live coals from the engine-fire
were hissing in the black canal stream; the
guard was bleeding and crushed beneath a wheel;
twining wreaths of white steam, like spirits,
melted into air above. Huntly was stooping
over a begrimed corpse. The glare of the lantern,
as it flashed upon the face, showed every
omen true. It was Marcliffe.</p>

<p>"I can bear to chronicle my own temptations,
yielding, guilt, but not to write down the separation
that I dreaded most, and tried to avert,
alas! so fatally. It is indeed a lesson of the
nothingness of man's subtlest plans to avoid the
penalty his crimes call down. How vain have
all my efforts been to preserve our hearth inviolate,
to keep our home in blessed security. Indeed,
that night God's peace and favor 'departed
from the threshold of the house' forever."</p>

<p>The misfortune alluded to was thus briefly
mentioned at the end of the newspaper report of
the accident, inclosed with the other papers of
the dead man:</p>

<p>"We are sorry to say that the wife of the
station-keeper, Darke, whose dangerous state
we noticed a week ago, expired last night, after
giving birth to a child, still-born."</p>

<p>With the sentence given above Darke's diary
closed. Here and there the curate read a verse
of a psalm, or a heart-broken ejaculation, but no
continued narrative of his after-sufferings. From
what he could glean, it appeared that he was put
on his trial on the charge of manslaughter, and
acquitted, but that he had lost his situation in
consequence of the want of presence of mind he
had evinced; after, it seemed, that he had led a
miserable vagrant life, earning just enough by
chance-work to support himself and his little
Harry, the constant attendant of his wanderings.
The boy was at the inn on the night of the father's
wretched death, though the landlady's
kindness removed him from the sight of the
troublous parting. An asylum was soon found
for him by my friend's kindness, and when I
was at the parsonage last Christmas, as I read
the history of his father's fitful life, the unconscious
son sat by with little Faith, gazing with
his large melancholy eyes at the strange faces
in the fire.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2>STORY OF A BEAR.</h2>


<p>Thirty leagues from Carlstad, and not far
from the borders of the Klar, upon the shores
of the lake Rada, rises a little hamlet named St.
John, the most smiling village of Scandinavia.
Its wooden houses, mirrored in the translucent
waters, stand in bold relief against a background
of extensive forests. For a space of twenty
leagues round, Nature has blessed the generous
soil with abundant harvests, filled the lake with
fish, and the woods with game. The inhabitants
of St. John are rich, without exception; each
year they make a profit of their harvests, and
bury beneath their hearthstones an addition to
their little fortunes.</p>

<p>In 1816, there lived at St. John a young man
of twenty years of age, named Daniel Tissjoebergist.
A fortunate youth he thought himself,
for he possessed two farms; and was affianced
to a pretty young girl, named Raghilda, celebrated
through all the province of Wermeland
for her shapely figure, her little feet, her blue
eyes, and fair skin, besides a certain caprice of
character that her beauty rendered excusable.</p>

<p>The daughter of a forester, and completely
spoiled by her father, who yielded to all her
whims, Raghilda was at the same time the torment
and the happiness of her affianced lover.
If he climbed the heights, and gathered the most
beautiful mountain flowers as a tribute to her
charms, that very day the fantastic beauty would
be seized with a severe headache, and have quite
a horror of perfumes. Did he bring her game
from the forest, she "could not comprehend,"
she would say, "how any man could leave a
pretty young girl to go and kill the poor hares."
One day he procured, at great expense, an assortment
of necklaces and gold rings from Europe.
He expected this time, at any rate, to be
recompensed for his pains; but Raghilda merely
declared that she much preferred to these rich
presents the heavy silver ornaments that decorate
Norwegian females. But she, nevertheless, took
care to adorn herself with the despised gifts, to
the intense envy of the other young girls her
companions.</p>

<p>According to universal Wermeland usage,
Raghilda kept bees. From morning to evening
she tended her hives, and the insects knew her
so well, that her presence did not scare them in
the least, but they hummed and buzzed around
her without testifying either fright or anger.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_787" id="Page_787">[Pg 787]</a></span>
Daniel, as our readers may imagine, never
visited his mistress without busying himself
among her bees. One day he took it into his
head that a high wall, standing just before the
hives, deprived them in part of the heat of the
sun, and compelled the insects to fly too high to
gain the plain, and collect their store of perfumed
honey. He proposed to Raghilda to diminish
the height of the offending wall by some feet.
At first the young girl would not entertain the
idea, merely because it came from her lover;
but she at length ceded to his reasonings, and
the wall was diminished in height.</p>

<p>For several weeks Daniel and Raghilda congratulated
themselves on the steps they had
taken. The full heat of the sun marvelously
quickened the eggs of the queen-bee, without
reckoning that the journey of the little workers
was shortened by one-half. But, alas! one fatal
morning, when the young girl placed herself at
her window to say good-day to her dear hives,
she beheld them overturned, crushed, deserted.
The honeycombs were broken all to pieces, and
the ground was strewed with the bodies of the
unfortunate insects. Upon Daniel's arrival, he
found his lovely Raghilda weeping despairingly
in the midst of the melancholy ruins.</p>

<p>The latter had thought of nothing beyond the
loss of her bees, her own sorrow, and, above all,
of her discontent with Daniel, and his pernicious
advice concerning the wall. Her lover, on the
contrary, vowed vengeance against the spoiler.</p>

<p>"I am," said he, "the involuntary cause of
your unhappiness, Raghilda, and to me it belongs
to avenge you. These traces of steps are no
human footmarks, but the impressions of a bear's
paw. I shall take my gun, fasten on my <i>skidars</i>,
and never return until I have killed the brigand."</p>

<p>Raghilda was too sorrowful for the loss of her
bees, and too furious against Daniel for his imprudent
advice about taking down the wall, to
make any reply, or even turn her head for a
parting glance. Her lover left her thus, and
hastened, his heart full of rage, to take his wooden
skates, called skidars in Norway, and set forth
in quest of the bear.</p>

<p>Tissjoebergist could not have proceeded far
without this singular <i>chaussure</i>. These skidars
are of unequal size; that which is fastened by
the leathern straps to the left leg is from nine to
twelve feet long, while to the right they do not
give more than six or seven. This inequality
procures ease to the hunter when he wishes to
turn round on broken ground; permitting him
to lean with all his weight upon the shorter skate,
fabricated of solid materials. The skidars are
about two inches in width, weigh from ten to
fifteen pounds, and terminate in highly raised
points, in order to avoid the obstacles that they
might encounter. The wearer slides with one,
and sustains himself with the other. The sole
is covered with a sea-calf's skin, with the hair
outside; this precaution hinders retrograde movements.
When the hunter is compelled to surmount
difficult heights, he does not lift his foot,
but proceeds nearly as we do upon the skates of
our country. He holds a stick in each hand, to
expedite or retard his course, and carries his
weapons in a shoulder-belt. Upon even ground,
it is easy to progress with the skidars, and a
man can accomplish forty leagues in twelve
hours. But, in the midst of a country like
Wermeland, alternately wooded, flat, mountainous,
and marshy, strewed with rocks and fallen
trees, the use of these skates requires much
courage, address, and, above all, presence of
mind. Daniel, habituated to their use from infancy,
skated with prodigious hardihood and celerity.
Quick as thought, he would now descend
the almost perpendicular face of a mountain, then
surmount a precipice, or clamber the steep sides
of a ravine. A slight movement of his body sufficed
to avoid the branches of trees, and a zigzag
to steer clear of the rocks strewn upon his path.
His ardent eye sought in the distance for the
enemy he pursued, or searched the soil for traces
of the brute's paws. But all his researches were
fruitless.</p>

<p>After three fatiguing days, passed without repose
or slumber, and almost without food, he returned
to St. John, in a state more easy to comprehend
than describe. Raghilda, during these
three days, had caused the wall to be built up
again, and was now occupied in arranging the
new hives with which Aulic-Finn, Daniel's rival,
had presented her, after having filled them with
bees by a process equally hardy and ingenious.
There was, in consequence of this, so violent a
quarrel between the engaged lovers, that Tissjoebergist
returned to Raghilda the ring which
she had given him one evening during a solitary
promenade on the umbrageous banks of the lake
Rada. The young girl took the ring, and threw it
with a gesture of contempt among the bee-hives.</p>

<p>"There!" said she, "the bear may have it.
He will not fail to come, for he knows that he
may ravage my hives with impunity."</p>

<p>Tissjoebergist assembled his friends, and informed
them of the affront that he had received.
Though a few were secretly pleased with the
humiliation of one whose manly beauty, address,
courage, and good fortune had often been the
subject of envy, they all declared that they would,
the very next day, undertake a general <i>skali</i>, that
is to say, a <i>grande battue</i>.</p>

<p>Eight days from the time of this declaration,
more than a thousand hunters formed themselves
into an immense semicircle, inclosing a space of
from five to six leagues. The other half-circle
was represented by a wide and deep pond, over
which it was impossible for their prey to escape
by swimming. Daniel directed the skali with
remarkable intelligence. By his orders, signals,
repeated from mouth to mouth, caused the hunters
to close up little by little, while a select band
beat the bushes.</p>

<p>They continued to advance in this way for
several hours, without discovering any thing save
troops of hares and other small game, that escaped
between the legs of the hunters. These
they did not attempt to molest, for they looked
only for the animal whose death Daniel had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_788" id="Page_788">[Pg 788]</a></span>
sworn to compass. Suddenly they heard a low
cry, and a gigantic bear, that had been hidden
behind a rock, abruptly rose, and stalked toward
Tissjoebergist. The youth took aim at the terrible
beast, and pulled the trigger of his musket.
It missed fire. The bear seized his weapon with
his powerful paws, twisted it like a wand, broke
it, and overturned Daniel in the mud. All this
passed with the rapidity of lightning. The monster
then took to flight, being hit in the shoulder
by a ball from Aulic-Finn; and the hunters saw
him climb the hill, after which he disappeared in
the forest. Daniel, foaming with rage, pursued
him thither at the head of his friends, but in vain.
Again the young man returned to St. John without
the vengeance he desired; well-nigh heartbroken
with shame and disappointment.</p>

<p>Raghilda welcomed Aulic-Finn most cordially,
and there was a report current in the village,
that she had picked up the discarded ring from
among the hives, to place it on the finger of Tissjoebergist's
rival. This the young girls whispered
among each other so loud, that Daniel
could not avoid overhearing them, though he did
not comprehend the full purport of their words.
Nor were the young men behind-hand in their
comments. There are never wanting unkind
hands to strike deeper the thorns that rankle in
our hearts.</p>

<p>In place of consoling himself by drinking and
feasting among his companions, as is the custom
in those parts after a hunt, successful or otherwise,
the unfortunate lover now resolved to have
recourse to the <i>gall</i>. This is a stratagem which
will be best explained by an account of Daniel's
preparations on the occasion.</p>

<p>He took a cow from his stables, tied a rope to
her horns, and dragged her along with so much
violence, that her lowings resounded through the
forest. Toward nightfall he arrived with the poor
beast near a sort of scaffolding constructed in the
thickest part of the wood, between three or four
trees, and about thirty feet from the ground.
Having tied the cow firmly by the rope to the
roots of an old and strong stump, he mounted
the scaffolding and awaited the issue.</p>

<p>The first night the lowings of the cow were
the only sounds that broke the melancholy silence
of the forest. It was the same the next day, and
the next. The fourth night, after a long struggle
with the drowsiness occasioned by the intense
cold, for the young hunter's provision of eau-de-vie
had long been exhausted, nature overcame
him, and he slept.</p>

<p>Then a huge bear raised his head from behind
the scaffolding, and having cautiously peered
around him, crept toward the cow, seized her
between his paws, and broke the rope that held
her. He turned his big pointed face toward the
slumbering hunter, and giving him an ironical
glance, disappeared with his shuddering prey
into the depths of the forest.</p>

<p>An hour afterward, Daniel awoke. The sun
had risen, and even in that shady place there
was light enough to distinguish the objects
around. He looked over the edge of the scaffolding,
and beheld the rope severed, and the
cow gone. Sliding down, he marked the humid
earth covered with the impressions of the bear's
claws. At this sight he thought he should have
gone mad.</p>

<p>He waited until nightfall before he re-entered
the village, and then, creeping to his house without
detection, he took a large knife, which he
placed in his belt, unfastened a dog that was
chained in the yard, and retook the road to the
forest. The season was the beginning of November,
the snow had fallen in abundance, and
it froze hard. Tissjoebergist skated along on
the sparkling ice, preceded by his dog, who,
from time to time halted, and smelt around him.
But these investigations led to no result, and the
animal continued his way. Cold tears fell down
Daniel's cheeks, and were quickly congealed into
icicles. For one moment he paused, took his
musket from the shoulder-belt in which he carried
it, pressed the cold barrel against his forehead,
and asked himself, whether it would not
be better to put an end to his disappointment and
his shame together. As he cast a last despairing
glance behind him, he perceived that his dog had
stopped, and was gazing immovably at a small
opening in some underwood, which was discovered
to him by the lurid rays of the aurora borealis.
A feeble hope dawned in Daniel's sick
heart; he advanced, and plainly saw a slight
hollow in the snow, undisturbed every where else.</p>

<p>The young man's heart beat violently. There,
doubtless, lay his enemy, gorged with the abundant
meal furnished by the cow. The hunter
strode on. The hole was not more than two feet
in diameter, and the bear might be distinctly
perceived squatting in the niche at about five feet
of depth. The noise of the hunter's approach
disturbed the animal. He stirred, opened his
heavy eyelids, and saw Daniel. He was about
to rush out, but a blow with the butt-end of the
musket drove him back to his hole with a large
wound in his eye, that streamed with blood.
Another bound, and the bear was free. He stood
erect, face to face with the young hunter, looked
upon him for a few seconds with the horrible
smile peculiar to these animals when in anger,
and precipitated himself upon his enemy. The
dog did not allow his master to be attacked with
impunity, and a <i>m&eacute;l&eacute;e</i> ensued that covered the
snow with blood. Daniel, seized by the shoulders,
and retained in the monster's clutches, had
the presence of mind to throw away his musket
and have recourse to his knife, with which he
made three large wounds in his adversary's side.
Then he seized him by the ears, and, ably seconded
by his dog, forced him to let go his hold.
The bear, enfeebled by loss of blood, yielded the
victory, and flew with so much swiftness, that
the dog, who immediately put himself upon his
track, was obliged to renounce the hope of overtaking
him. The faithful animal returned to his
master, whom he found insensible, his face torn
to ribbons, his breast lacerated, and his shoulders
covered with large wounds. Some peasants happening
to pass that way raised the unhappy young<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_789" id="Page_789">[Pg 789]</a></span>
man in their arms, and brought him to St. John,
where he long lay between life and death. He
would rather have been left to die, for life was
become insupportable. Bears could not be mentioned
before him without his detecting lurking
smiles in the faces of his associates. To crown
all, the approaching marriage of Raghilda and
Aulic-Finn was no longer a mystery. Daniel
had partly lost the use of his right arm, and a
bite inflicted by the bear upon his nose had ruined
the noble and regular features of the poor youth,
and given him a countenance nearly as frightful
as that of his adversary. He fell into a profound
melancholy, sold his two farms and all his land,
quitted Wermeland, sojourned about two months
at Carlstad, and finally disappeared altogether
from Scandinavia.</p>

<p>During this period, some hunters who were
exploring the banks of the Klar, found, near the
parish of Tima, a one-eyed bear, pierced with
three strokes of a poniard, and in a dying condition.
They took him without resistance, dressed
his wounds, and carried him to a neighboring
village. There they hired a light cart, placed
him upon it, and took him along with them.</p>

<p>The recovery of their patient was more rapid
than they had dared to hope. When the convalescent
animal began to gain his strength, he
was inclosed in a large cage, conveniently furnished
with iron bars. As he was of gigantic
stature, and possessed a magnificent coat, he
proved a very lucrative acquisition as a show to
the gaping multitude, and soon made the fortune
of the <i>cornac</i> who bought him.</p>

<p>It was thus that the wild inhabitant of the
forests of Wermeland became a cosmopolitan,
and traversed Norway, Sweden, Germany and
Prussia. In course of time he arrived in France,
where his enormous proportions, savage mien,
and thick fur, procured him the honor of being
bought, for 360 francs, by M. Frederic Cuvier.
He was brought in his cage to the habitation
prepared for him in the Jardin des Plantes.
There he was released from his narrow prison,
and respired once more the fresh breeze.</p>

<p>This first sensation exhausted, he slowly explored
his new abode. It was a species of cellar
open to the air, twenty-five feet by thirty,
and twenty feet in depth. Its walls were of
smooth stone, that left no hold for the claws of
its Scandinavian tenant. At one end was a kind
of den, furnished with iron bars, that vividly recalled
his first cage, and at the other a supply
of water that fell into a trough of blue stone.
In the middle stood a tree despoiled of its leaves
and bark, upon which the little boys that had
crowded round were continually throwing morsels
of bread and apple-cores tied to long strings,
crying, at the same time, "Martin! Martin!"</p>

<p>The bear disdainfully eyed the bread and the
apple-cores, uttered a furious bellow, and embracing
the trunk of the tree endeavored to overthrow
it; but it stood the shock well, and did
not even stagger. The cries were repeated, accompanied
by insolent roars of laughter.</p>

<p>For the first few days the new-comer remained
disdainfully squatted in his den. They might
throw him cakes as they pleased, he did not even
look at them. If some blackguard occasionally
resorted to stones, it merely excited a jerking
movement of the animal's paws, and a display of
his white teeth. But, at the end of a week, he
began, not without some false shame, to glance
out of the corner of his eye at the tempting morsels
of cake or tartlets that lay around him.</p>

<p>At length he furtively laid his paw upon one
of the nice-looking bits, drew it toward him, slily
dispatched it, and acknowledged that the Parisian
pastry-cooks understood their business. The
next day the stoic became an epicure, and collected
the morsels that were thrown to him. A
little time afterward, he remarked a dog sitting
upon his hind legs, and agitating his fore-paws,
to the great delight of the children, who lavished
cakes upon the clever beast. A venal thought
entered the mind of the bear. He imitated the
cur, and begged.</p>

<p>The degraded savage now hesitated at nothing.
He climbed the tree as the last bear had done,
danced, saluted, imitated death, and performed,
for the least bribe of bread or fruit, the most ridiculous
grimaces. The fame of his gentleness
spread through all Paris. Nothing was talked of
but Martin, his intelligence and docility. His reputation
circulated through the departments, and
foreign journals quoted anecdotes of his sagacity.</p>

<p>For about ten years Martin feasted in peace,
and enjoyed all the advantages of his servile
submission. One beautiful summer afternoon,
he was lying in the shade, nonchalantly digesting
his food, when he happened to glance at the
crowd that surrounded the pit. Suddenly he
rose with a terrible bound, and rushed toward a
shabbily-dressed man, whose visage was horribly
cicatrized, and who leaned upon a knotty stick
as he gazed down at the bear. The animal
growled, writhed, opened his muzzle, and exhibited
the most frightful evidences of anger.
The man was not more placable; he brandished
his stick with curses and menaces.</p>

<p>"I recognize thee," he cried in a strange
tongue; "thou art the cause of my shame, my
wounds, and my misery. It is thou that hast
robbed me of happiness, and made me a wretched
crippled-mendicant. It shall not be said that
I died without revenge."</p>

<p>The bear, by his cries of rage, testified equally
that he had recognized his enemy, and held himself
in a posture of defiance.</p>

<p>The stranger drew from his pocket a large
sharp-pointed knife, calculated, with a frightful
<i>sang froid</i>, the leap that he would have to take,
and jumped into the pit, brandishing his weapon.
Unfortunately, on reaching the ground, he sprained
his foot against one of the stones that paved
the pit, and which had got displaced. The crowd
beheld him fall, and then saw the bear rush upon
him, avoid the knife, and, keeping his victim
down, play with his head as if it had been a ball,
knocking it backward and forward between his
paws. Lastly, the incensed animal placed himself
upon the breast of the stranger, and stifled<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_790" id="Page_790">[Pg 790]</a></span>
him, with every sign of hideous and ferocious
triumph. All this passed in less time than we
have taken to describe it. The keepers ran to
the rescue, and obliged the bear to retire into his
iron-grated den. The animal peaceably obeyed,
with the visible satisfaction of a satiated vengeance.
When they came to raise the man, they
found that he was dead.</p>

<p>With the Parisians, every stranger is an Englishman.
The report soon spread, confirmed
by the journals, that Martin's victim was what
they then called an <i>insulaire</i>. Few persons
knew that Martin had killed his ancient adversary,
the unfortunate Daniel Tissjoebergist.</p>

<p>The following day the bear mounted the tree,
excelled himself, picked up the morsels of <i>galette</i>
that were thrown down by his admirers, basked
in the sun's rays, and regarded with his one small
ferocious eye the spot where, the evening before,
he had accomplished his long meditated revenge.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2>THE SICILIAN VESPERS.</h2>


<p>Half a mile from the southern wall of the
city, on the brink of the ravine of Oreto,
stands a church dedicated to the Holy Ghost,
concerning which the Latin fathers have not failed
to record, that on the day on which the first
stone of it was laid, in the twelfth century, the
sun was darkened by an eclipse. On one side
of it are the precipice and the river, on the other
the plain extending to the city, which in the present
day is in great part encumbered with walls
and gardens; while a square inclosure of moderate
size, shaded by dusky cypresses, honey-combed
with tombs, and adorned with urns and sepulchral
monuments, surrounds the church.</p>

<p>This is now a public cemetery, laid out toward
the end of the eighteenth century, and fearfully
filled in three weeks by the dire pestilence which
devastated Sicily in 1837. On the Tuesday, at
the hour of vespers, religion and custom crowded
this then cheerful plain, carpeted with the flowers
of spring, with citizens wending their way toward
the church. Divided into numerous groups,
they walked, sat in clusters, spread the tables, or
danced upon the grass; and, whether it were a
defect or a merit of the Sicilian character, threw
off for the moment, the recollection of their sufferings,
when the followers of the justiciary suddenly
appeared among them, and every bosom
was thrilled with a shudder of disgust. The
strangers came, with their usual insolent demeanor,
as they said, to maintain tranquillity;
and for this purpose they mingled in the groups,
joined in the dances, and familiarly accosted the
women, pressing the hand of one, taking unwarranted
liberties with others; addressing indecent
words and gestures to those more distant, until
some temperately admonished them to depart, in
God's-name, without insulting the women, and
others murmured angrily; but the hot-blooded
youths raised their voices so fiercely that the soldiers
said one to another, "These insolent paterini
must be armed that they dare thus to answer,"
and replied to them with the most offensive
insults, insisting, with great insolence, on
searching them for arms, and even here and there
striking them with sticks or thongs. Every heart
already throbbed fiercely on either side, when a
young woman of singular beauty and of modest
and dignified deportment, appeared with her husband
and relations, bending their steps toward
the church. Drouet, a Frenchman, impelled
either by insolence or license, approached her as
if to examine her for concealed weapons; seized
her and searched her bosom. She fell fainting
into her husband's arms, who, in a voice almost
choked with rage, exclaimed, "Death, death to
the French!" At that moment a youth burst
from the crowd which had gathered round them,
sprang upon Drouet, disarmed and slew him;
and probably at the same moment paid the penalty
of his own life, leaving his name unknown,
and the mystery forever unsolved, whether it
were love for the injured woman, the impulse of
a generous heart, or the more exalted flame of
patriotism, that prompted him thus to give the
signal of deliverance. Noble examples have a
power far beyond that of argument or eloquence
to rouse the people&mdash;and the abject slaves awoke
at length from their long bondage. "Death,
death to the French!" they cried; and the cry,
say the historians of the time, re-echoed like the
voice of God through the whole country, and
found an answer in every heart. Above the
corpse of Drouet were heaped those of victims
slain on either side; the crowd expanded itself,
closed in, and swayed hither and thither in wild
confusion; the Sicilians, with sticks, stones, and
knives, rushed with desperate ferocity upon their
fully-armed opponents; they sought for them and
hunted them down; fearful tragedies were enacted
amid the preparations for festivity, and the
overthrown tables were drenched in blood. The
people displayed their strength, and conquered.
The struggle was brief, and great the slaughter
of the Sicilians; but of the French there were
two hundred&mdash;and two hundred fell.</p>

<p>Breathless, covered with blood, brandishing
the plundered weapons, and proclaiming the insult
and its vengeance, the insurgents rushed toward
the tranquil city. "Death to the French!"
they shouted, and as many as they found were
put to the sword. The example, the words, the
contagion of passion, in an instant aroused the
whole people. In the heat of the tumult, Roger
Mastrangelo, a nobleman, was chosen, or constituted
himself their leader. The multitude continued
to increase; dividing into troops they
scoured the streets, burst open doors, searched
every nook, every hiding-place, and shouting
"Death to the French!" smote them and slew
them, while those too distant to strike added to
the tumult by their applause. On the outbreak
of this sudden uproar the justiciary had taken
refuge in his strong palace; the next moment
it was surrounded by an enraged multitude, crying
aloud for his death; they demolished the defenses,
and rushed furiously in, but the justiciary
escaped them; favored by the confusion and the
closing darkness, he succeeded, though wounded
in the face, in mounting his horse unobserved,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_791" id="Page_791">[Pg 791]</a></span>
with only two attendants, and fled with all speed.
Meanwhile the slaughter continued with increased
ferocity, even the darkness of night failed to
arrest it, and it was resumed on the morrow more
furiously than ever; nor did it cease at length because
the thirst for vengeance was slaked, but
because victims were wanting to appease it. Two
thousand French perished in this first outbreak.
Even Christian burial was denied them, but pits
were afterward dug to receive their despised remains;
and tradition still points out a column
surmounted by an iron cross, raised by compassionate
piety on one of those spots, probably long
after the perpetration of the deed of vengeance.
Tradition, moreover, relates that the sound of a
word, like the Shibboleth of the Hebrews, was the
cruel test by which the French were distinguished
in the massacre; and that, if there were found a
suspicious or unknown person, he was compelled,
with a sword to his throat, to pronounce the word
<i>ciciri</i>, and the slightest foreign accent was the
signal of his death. Forgetful of their own character,
and as if stricken by fate, the gallant warriors
of France neither fled, nor united, nor defended
themselves; they unsheathed their swords,
and presented them to their assailants, imploring,
as if in emulation of each other, to be the first to
die; of one common soldier only is it recorded,
that having concealed himself behind a wainscot,
and being dislodged at the sword's point, he resolved
not to die unavenged, and springing with
a wild cry upon the ranks of his enemies, slew
three of them before he himself perished. The
insurgents broke into the convents of the Minorites
and Preaching Friars, and slaughtered all
the monks whom they recognized as French.
Even the altars afforded no protection; tears
and prayers were alike unheeded; neither old
men, women, nor infants, were spared; the ruthless
avengers of the ruthless massacre of Agosta
swore to root out the seed of the French oppressors
throughout the whole of Sicily; and this
vow they cruelly fulfilled, slaughtering infants at
their mothers' breast, and after them the mothers
themselves, nor sparing even pregnant women,
but, with a horrible refinement of cruelty, ripping
up the bodies of Sicilian women who were with
child by French husbands, and dashing against
the stones the fruit of the mingled blood of the
oppressors and the oppressed. This general massacre
of all who spoke the same language, and
these heinous acts of cruelty, have caused the
Sicilian Vespers to be classed among the most
infamous of national crimes. But these fill a
vast volume, and in it all nations have inscribed
horrors of a similar, and sometimes of a blacker
dye; nations often more civilized, and in times
less rude, and not only in the assertion of their
liberty or against foreign tyrants, but in the delirium
of civil or religious partisanship, against
fellow-citizens, against brothers, against innocent
and helpless beings, whom they destroyed by
thousands, sweeping away whole populations.
Therefore I do not blush for my country at the
remembrance of the vespers, but bewail the dire
necessity which drove Sicily to such extremities.</p>

<h2>A SHORT CHAPTER ON FROGS.</h2>


<p>In one of Steele's papers in the "Guardian"
is the following passage: "I observe the sole
reason alleged for the destruction of frogs, is because
they are like toads. Yet amidst all the
misfortunes of these unfriended creatures, it is
some happiness that we have not yet taken a
fancy to eat them; for should our countrymen
refine upon the French never so little, it is not to
be conceived to what unheard-of torments owls,
cats, and frogs may be yet reserved."</p>

<p>That frogs constituted the chief diet of Frenchmen
was, a few years ago, as popular and beloved
an article of belief among British lads, as that
one Englishman was equal to three of the said
frog-consumers. More extended intercourse has,
however, shown us that frogs do not constitute
the entire food of our Gallic neighbors, and taught
them that <i>we</i> do not all wear top-boots, and subsist
solely on beef-steaks. As, however, frogs <i>do</i>
form a dainty dish, I will give what the Yankees
term a "few notions consarning them and their
fixings."</p>

<p>Happening to be in Germany in 1846, I was
desirous of getting some insight into the manners
and customs of these inhabitants of the ponds,
and, after much observation, arrived at the same
conclusion concerning them as the master of one
of Her Majesty's ships did respecting the subjects
of the Imaun of Muscat. Being compelled
to record categorically a reply to the inquiry,
"What are the manners and customs of the inhabitants?"
he wrote, "Manners they have none,
and their customs, are very beastly." So of these
frogs, say I.</p>

<p>My knowledge of their vicinity was based upon
auricular confession. Night after night the most
infernal din of croaking bore testimony to the
fact that they were unburdening their consciences,
and I determined to try if I could not unburden
their bodies of their batrachian souls altogether.
However, before I detail my proceedings, I have
a word to say with reference to their croaking.</p>

<p>Horace bears expressive testimony to the disgust
<i>he</i> felt at it, when, after a heavy supper to
help him on his way to Brundusium, he exclaimed</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&mdash;&mdash;"Mali culices, ran&aelig;que palustres Avertunt somnos."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>So loud and continuous is their song, especially
in the breeding season, that in the former good
old times of France, when nobles <i>were</i> nobles,
and lived in their magnificent chateaus scattered
throughout the country, the peasants were employed
during the whole night in beating the
ponds within ear-shot of the chateaus, with
boughs of trees, to prevent the slumbers of the
lords and ladies being broken by their paludine
neighbors. This croaking is produced by the
air being driven from the lungs into the puffed-out
cavity of the mouth, or into certain guttural
sacculi, which are developed very largely in the
males. They can produce this noise under water
as well as on land.</p>

<p>In the male frog there are fissures at the corners
of the mouth for admitting the external protrusion<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_792" id="Page_792">[Pg 792]</a></span>
of the vocal sacculi. These sacculi they invariably
protrude in their struggles to escape when held
by the hind legs. Under these circumstances
they are also capable of uttering a peculiar shrill
cry of distress, differing completely from their
ordinary croak.</p>

<p>Having obtained a land net, I cautiously approached
the pond, which I knew must abound
with them, from the concerts nightly held there,
and without allowing the shadow to fall on the
water, or making the slightest noise; yet the
moment I showed myself, every individual who
happened to be above water jumped off his perch,
and was out of sight in an instant. I tried every
means to catch them, but in vain. At last I borrowed
from some boys a long tube of wood, with
a small hole smoothly and equally bored through
the centre, which they used to shoot small birds
about the hedges. Armed with some arrows
made of sharp tin nails, tipped with cotton wool,
I ensconced myself in a bush, and waited quietly
for my prey. In a few moments, the frogs, one
by one, began to poke their noses out of the
water. I selected the finest, and by dint of a
good shot, I succeeded in fixing an arrow in his
head. In the course of the afternoon I bagged
several of the patriarchs of the pond, some of
them as large as the largest English toad. Upon
being struck with the arrow, they nearly all protruded
their sacculi from each side of the mouth,
in the manner above narrated.</p>

<p>These frogs are not often used for the table in
Germany, but in France they are considered a
luxury, as any <i>bon vivant</i> ordering a dish of them
at the "Trois Fr&egrave;res" at Paris may, by the long
price, speedily ascertain. Not wishing to try
such an expensive experiment in gastronomy, I
went to the large market in the Faubourg St.
Germain, and inquired for frogs. I was referred
to a stately-looking dame at a fish-stall, who produced
a box nearly full of them, huddling and
crawling about, and occasionally croaking as
though aware of the fate to which they were destined.
The price fixed was two a penny, and
having ordered a dish to be prepared, the Dame
de la Halle dived her hand in among them, and
having secured her victim by the hind legs, she
severed him in twain with a sharp knife, the legs,
minus skin, still struggling, were placed on a
dish; and the head, with the fore-legs affixed,
retained life and motion, and performed such
motions that the operation became painful to look
at. These legs were afterward cooked at the
restaurateur's, being served up fried in bread
crumbs, as larks are in England: and most excellent
eating they were, tasting more like the
delicate flesh of the rabbit than any thing else I
can think of.</p>

<p>I afterward tried a dish of the common English
frog, but their flesh is not so white nor so tender
as that of their French brothers.</p>

<p>The old fish-wife of whom I bought these frogs,
informed me that she had a man regularly in her
employ to catch them. He went out every evening
at dusk to the ponds, in the neighborhood of Paris,
with a lantern and a long stick, to the end of
which was attached a piece of red cloth. The
frogs were attracted by the light to the place
where the fisherman stood. He then lightly
dropped his cloth on the surface of the water;
the frogs imagining that some dainty morsel was
placed before them, eagerly snapped at it, and
their teeth becoming entangled, they became an
easy prey, destined for to-morrow's market, and
the tender mercies of the fish-woman.</p>

<p>I subsequently brought over several dozen of
these frogs alive to England, some of them are
still, I believe, living in the Ward's botanical cases
of those to whom I presented them, the rest were
turned out in a pond, where I fear they have been
devoured by the gourmand English ducks, the
rightful occupants of the pond.</p>

<p>The edible frog (<i>rana esculenta</i>) is brought
from the country, in quantities of from thirty to
forty thousand at a time, to Vienna, and sold to
great dealers, who have conservatories for them,
which are large holes four or five feet deep, dug
in the ground, the mouth covered with a board,
and in severe weather with straw. In these
conservatories, even during a hard frost, the frogs
never become quite torpid, they get together in
heaps one upon another instinctively, and thereby
prevent the evaporation of their humidity, for
no water is ever put to them.</p>

<p>In Vienna, in 1793, there were only three
dealers, who supplied the market with frogs
ready skinned and prepared for the cook.</p>

<p>There is another species of frog common on
the Continent, which is turned to a useful account
as a barometer. It is the <i>rana arborea</i>,
of which many specimens are to be seen in the
Zoological Gardens. It has the property, like the
chameleon, of adapting its color to the substance
on which it may be placed: it especially inhabits
trees, and when among the foliage, is of a brilliant
green; when on the ground, or on the
branches of trees, the color is brown. They are
thus used as prognosticators. Two or three are
placed in a tall glass jar, with three or four
inches of water at the bottom, and a small ladder
reaching to the top of the jar. On the approach
of dry weather the frogs mount the ladder
to the very top, but when rain may be expected,
they not only make a peculiar singing
noise, but descend into the water. Small frogs
are a trilling bait for pike and perch, and this
reminds me of an incident which I saw. A fine
perch was found floating dead, on the top of the
water in a pond, in one of the gardens at Oxford;
upon examination, it was found to be very
thin, and apparently starved to death, some devotee
to the gentle art had been the unconscious
cause of the sad fate of this poor fish, for a hook
was found firmly fixed in his upper jaw, the
shock of which projected so far beyond his mouth,
that his efforts to obtain food must have been
useless, the hook always projecting forward, kept
him at a tantalizing distance from the desired
morsel. The fish has been dried, and is now
preserved with the hook fixed in his mouth.</p>

<p>But fishes, which, like perch, are provided with
sharp prickles, occasionally cause the death of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_793" id="Page_793">[Pg 793]</a></span>
those creatures that feed upon them. A king-fisher
was brought to me in the summer of 1848,
by a boy who had found it dead on the banks of
the river Cherwell, near Oxford, no shot, or
other marks of injury were found on it, the
feathers being perfectly smooth, dry, and unstained;
what then was the cause of death?&mdash;upon
a careful examination, I found the end of
a small fish's tail protruding from one of the corners
of its mouth, I endeavored to drag it out,
but in vain, it was firmly fixed. By dissection,
I found, that the fish in question was one of the
tribe of small fish which abound in shallow water,
and are called in Oxford, the bull's head, or miller's
thumb. It has a strong prickle, nearly a
quarter of an inch long, with very sharp and firm
end, projecting on each side of its gills. The
fish had, in its struggles, protruded its prickles,
which, sticking in his enemy's &oelig;sophagus, had
effectually stopped up the entrance, pressing on
the wind-pipe, and thus caused its death.</p>

<h2>MY NOVEL; OR, VARIETIES IN ENGLISH LIFE.<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a></h2>


<h3>CHAPTER X.</h3>

<p>The next morning Harley appeared at breakfast.
He was in gay spirits, and conversed
more freely with Violante than he had yet done.
He seemed to amuse himself by attacking all she
said, and provoking her to argument. Violante
was naturally a very earnest person; whether
grave or gay, she spoke with her heart on her
lips, and her soul in her eyes. She did not yet
comprehend the light vein of Harley's irony; so
she grew piqued and chafed; and she was so
lovely in anger; it so brightened her beauty and
animated her words, that no wonder Harley thus
maliciously teased her. But what, perhaps, she
liked still less than the teasing&mdash;though she could
not tell why&mdash;was the kind of familiarity that
Harley assumed with her&mdash;a familiarity as if he
had known her all her life&mdash;that of a good-humored
elder brother, or bachelor uncle. To Helen,
on the contrary, when he did not address her
apart, his manner was more respectful. He did
not call <i>her</i> by her Christian name, as he did
Violante, but "Miss Digby," and softened his
tone and inclined his head when he spoke to her.
Nor did he presume to jest at the very few and
brief sentences he drew from Helen; but rather
listened to them with deference, and invariably
honored them with approval. After breakfast he
asked Violante to play or sing; and when she
frankly owned how little she had cultivated those
accomplishments, he persuaded Helen to sit down
to the piano, and stood by her side while she did
so, turning over the leaves of her music-book with
the ready devotion of an admiring amateur. Helen
always played well, but less well than usual
that day, for her generous nature felt abashed.
It was as if she was showing off to mortify Violante.
But Violante, on the other hand, was so
passionately fond of music that she had no feeling
left for the sense of her own inferiority. Yet
she sighed when Helen rose, and Harley thanked
her for the delight she had given him.</p>

<p>The day was fine. Lady Lansmere proposed
to walk in the garden. While the ladies went
up-stairs for their shawls and bonnets, Harley
lighted his cigar, and stept from the window upon
the lawn. Lady Lansmere joined him before the
girls came out.</p>

<p>"Harley," said she, taking his arm, "what a
charming companion you have introduced to us!
I never met with any that both pleased and delighted
me like this dear Violante. Most girls
who possess some power of conversation, and who
have dared to think for themselves, are so
pedantic, or so masculine; but <i>she</i> is always so
simple, and always still the girl. Ah, Harley!"</p>

<p>"Why that sigh, my dear mother?"</p>

<p>"I was thinking how exactly she would have
suited you&mdash;how proud I should have been of
such a daughter-in-law&mdash;and how happy you
would have been with such a wife."</p>

<p>Harley started. "Tut," said he, peevishly,
"she is a mere child; you forget my years."</p>

<p>"Why," said Lady Lansmere, surprised, "Helen
is quite as young as Violante."</p>

<p>"In dates&mdash;yes. But Helen's character is so
staid; what it is now it will be ever; and Helen,
from gratitude, respect, or pity, condescends to
accept the ruins of my heart; while this bright
Italian has the soul of a Juliet, and would expect
in a husband all the passion of a Romeo.
Nay, mother, hush. Do you forget that I am
engaged&mdash;and of my own free will and choice?
Poor dear Helen! Apropos, have you spoken to
my father, as you undertook to do?"</p>

<p>"Not yet. I must seize the right moment.
You know that my lord requires management."</p>

<p>"My dear mother, that female notion of managing
us, men, costs you, ladies, a great waste
of time, and occasions us a great deal of sorrow.
Men are easily managed by plain truth. <i>We</i> are
brought up to respect it, strange as it may seem
to you!"</p>

<p>Lady Lansmere smiled with the air of superior
wisdom, and the experience of an accomplished
wife. "Leave it to me, Harley; and rely on my
lord's consent."</p>

<p>Harley knew that Lady Lansmere always succeeded
in obtaining her way with his father; and
he felt that the Earl might naturally be disappointed
in such an alliance, and, without due
propitiation, evince that disappointment in his
manner to Helen. Harley was bound to save
her from all chance of such humiliation. He did
not wish her to think that she was not welcomed
into his family; therefore he said, "I resign myself
to your promise and your diplomacy. Meanwhile,
as you love me, be kind to my betrothed."</p>

<p>"Am I not so?"</p>

<p>"Hem. Are you as kind as if she were the
great heiress you believe Violante to be?"</p>

<p>"Is it," answered Lady Lansmere, evading
the question&mdash;"is it because one is an heiress
and the other is not that you make so marked a
difference in your manner to the two; treating<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_794" id="Page_794">[Pg 794]</a></span>
Violante as a spoiled child, and Miss Digby
as&mdash;"</p>

<p>"The destined wife of Lord L'Estrange, and
the daughter-in-law of Lady Lansmere&mdash;yes."</p>

<p>The Countess suppressed an impatient exclamation
that rose to her lips, for Harley's brow
wore that serious aspect which it rarely assumed
save when he was in those moods in which men
must be soothed, not resisted. And after a pause
he went on&mdash;"I am going to leave you to-day.
I have engaged apartments at the Clarendon. I
intend to gratify your wish, so often expressed,
that I should enjoy what are called the pleasures
of my rank, and the privileges of single-blessedness&mdash;celebrate
my adieu to celibacy, and blaze
once more, with the splendor of a setting sun,
upon Hyde Park and May Fair."</p>

<p>"You are a positive enigma. Leave our house,
just when you are betrothed to its inmate! Is
that the natural conduct of a lover?"</p>

<p>"How can your woman eyes be so dull, and
your woman heart so obtuse?" answered Harley,
half-laughing, half-scolding. "Can you not
guess that I wish that Helen and myself should
both lose the association of mere ward and guardian;
that the very familiarity of our intercourse
under the same roof almost forbids us to be lovers;
that we lose the joy to meet, and the pang
to part. Don't you remember the story of the
Frenchman, who for twenty years loved a lady,
and never missed passing his evenings at her
house. She became a widow. 'I wish you joy,'
cried his friend; 'you may now marry the woman
you have so long adored.' 'Alas,' said the poor
Frenchman, profoundly dejected; 'and if so, where
shall I spend my evenings?'"</p>

<p>Here Violante and Helen were seen in the garden,
walking affectionately, arm in arm.</p>

<p>"I don't perceive the point of your witty,
heartless anecdote," said Lady Lansmere, obstinately.
"Settle that, however, with Miss Digby.
But, to leave the very day after your friend's
daughter comes as a guest!&mdash;what will <i>she</i> think
of it?"</p>

<p>Lord L'Estrange looked steadfastly at his
mother. "Does it matter much what she thinks
of me?&mdash;of a man engaged to another; and old
enough to be&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I wish to Heaven you would not talk of your
age, Harley; it is a reflection upon mine; and I
never saw you look so well nor so handsome."
With that she drew him on toward the young
ladies; and, taking Helen's arm, asked her, aside,
"if she knew that Lord L'Estrange had engaged
rooms at the Clarendon; and if she understood
why?" As, while she said this she moved on,
Harley was left by Violante's side.</p>

<p>"You will be very dull here, I fear, my poor
child," said he.</p>

<p>"Dull! But why <i>will</i> you call me child?
Am I so very&mdash;very childlike?"</p>

<p>"Certainly, you are to me&mdash;a mere infant.
Have I not seen you one; have I not held you
in my arms?"</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Violante.</span>&mdash;"But that was a long time ago!"</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Harley.</span>&mdash;"True. But if years have not
stood still for you, they have not been stationary
for me. There is the same difference between
us now that there was then. And, therefore,
permit me still to call you child, and as child to
treat you!"</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Violante.</span>&mdash;"I will do no such thing. Do you
know that I always thought I was good-tempered
till this morning."</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Harley</span>.&mdash;"And what undeceived you? Did
you break your doll?"</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Violante</span> (with an indignant flash from her
dark eyes).&mdash;"There!&mdash;again!&mdash;you delight in
provoking me!"</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Harley.</span>&mdash;"It <i>was</i> the doll, then. Don't cry;
I will get you another."</p>

<p>Violante plucked her arm from him, and walked
away toward the Countess in speechless scorn.
Harley's brow contracted, in thought and in gloom.
He stood still for a moment or so, and then joined
the ladies.</p>

<p>"I am trespassing sadly on your morning; but
I wait for a visitor whom I sent to before you
were up. He is to be here at twelve. With
your permission, I will dine with you to-morrow,
and you will invite him to meet me."</p>

<p>"Certainly. And who is your friend? I guess&mdash;the
young author?"</p>

<p>"Leonard Fairfield," cried Violante, who had
conquered, or felt ashamed of her short-lived
anger.</p>

<p>"Fairfield!" repeated Lady Lansmere. "I
thought, Harley, you said the name was Oran."</p>

<p>"He has assumed the latter name. He is the
son of Mark Fairfield, who married an Avenel.
Did you recognize no family likeness?&mdash;none in
those eyes&mdash;mother?" said Harley, sinking his
voice into a whisper.</p>

<p>"No," answered the Countess, falteringly.</p>

<p>Harley, observing that Violante was now
speaking to Helen about Leonard, and that
neither was listening to him, resumed in the
same low tone. "And his mother&mdash;Nora's sister&mdash;shrank
from seeing me! That is the reason
why I wished you not to call. She has not told
the young man <i>why</i> she shrank from seeing me;
nor have I explained it to him as yet. Perhaps
I never shall."</p>

<p>"Indeed, dearest Harley," said the Countess,
with great gentleness, "I wish you too much to
forget the folly&mdash;well, I will not say that word&mdash;the
sorrows of your boyhood, not to hope that
you will rather strive against such painful memories
than renew them by unnecessary confidence
to any one: least of all to the relation of&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Enough! don't name her; the very name
pains me. As to the confidence, there are but
two persons in the world to whom I ever bare
the old wounds&mdash;yourself and Egerton. Let this
pass. Ha!&mdash;a ring at the bell&mdash;that is he!"</p>


<h3>CHAPTER XI.</h3>

<p>Leonard entered on the scene, and joined the
party in the garden. The Countess, perhaps to
please her son, was more than civil&mdash;she was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_795" id="Page_795">[Pg 795]</a></span>
markedly kind to him. She noticed him more
attentively than she had hitherto done; and,
with all her prejudices of birth, was struck to
find the son of Mark Fairfield, the carpenter, so
thoroughly the gentleman. He might not have
the exact tone and phrase by which Convention
stereotypes those born and schooled in a certain
world; but the aristocrats of Nature can dispense
with such trite minuti&aelig;. And Leonard had
lived, of late, at least, in the best society that
exists, for the polish of language and the refinement
of manners&mdash;the society in which the most
graceful ideas are clothed in the most graceful
forms&mdash;the society which really, though indirectly,
gives the law to courts&mdash;the society of the
most classic authors, in the various ages in which
literature has flowered forth from civilization.
And if there was something in the exquisite
sweetness of Leonard's voice, look, and manner,
which the Countess acknowledged to attain that
perfection in high breeding, which, under the
name of "suavity," steals its way into the heart,
so her interest in him was aroused by a certain
subdued melancholy which is rarely without distinction,
and never without charm. He and Helen
exchanged but few words. There was but
one occasion in which they could have spoken
apart, and Helen herself contrived to elude it.
His face brightened at Lady Lansmere's cordial
invitation, and he glanced at Helen as he accepted
it; but her eyes did not meet his own.</p>

<p>"And now," said Harley, whistling to Nero,
whom his ward was silently caressing, "I must
take Leonard away. Adieu! all of you, till to-morrow
at dinner. Miss Violante, is the doll to
have blue or black eyes?"</p>

<p>Violante turned her own black eyes in mute
appeal to Lady Lansmere, and nestled to that
lady's side as if in refuge from unworthy insult.</p>


<h3>CHAPTER XII.</h3>

<p>"Let the carriage go to the Clarendon," said
Harley to his servant; "I and Mr. Oran will
walk to town. Leonard, I think you would rejoice
at an occasion to serve your old friends,
Dr. Riccabocca and his daughter?"</p>

<p>"Serve them! O yes." And there instantly
occurred to Leonard the recollection of Violante's
words when on leaving his quiet village he had
sighed to part from all those he loved; and the
little dark-eyed girl had said, proudly, yet consolingly,
"But to <span class="smcap">serve</span> those you love!" He
turned to L'Estrange with beaming, inquisitive
eyes.</p>

<p>"I said to our friend," resumed Harley, "that
I would vouch for your honor as my own. I am
about to prove my words, and to confide the secrets
which your penetration has indeed divined;&mdash;our
friend is not what he seems." Harley then
briefly related to Leonard the particulars of the
exile's history, the rank he had held in his native
land, the manner in which, partly through the
misrepresentations of a kinsman he had trusted,
partly through the influence of a wife he had
loved, he had been driven into schemes which he
believed bounded to the emancipation of Italy
from a foreign yoke by the united exertions of her
best and bravest sons.</p>

<p>"A noble ambition," interrupted Leonard,
manfully. "And pardon me, my lord, I should
not have thought that you would speak of it in a
tone that implies blame."</p>

<p>"The ambition in itself was noble," answered
Harley. "But the cause to which it was devoted
became defiled in its dark channel through Secret
Societies. It is the misfortune of all miscellaneous
political combinations, that with the purest
motives of their more generous members are ever
mixed the most sordid interests, and the fiercest
passions of mean confederates. When these combinations
act openly, and in daylight, under the
eye of Public Opinion, the healthier elements
usually prevail; where they are shrouded in mystery&mdash;where
they are subjected to no censor in
the discussion of the impartial and dispassionate&mdash;where
chiefs working in the dark exact blind
obedience, and every man who is at war with law
is at once admitted as a friend of freedom&mdash;the
history of the world tells us that patriotism soon
passes away. Where all is in public, public virtue,
by the natural sympathies of the common
mind, and by the wholesome control of shame, is
likely to obtain ascendency; where all is in private,
and shame is but for him who refuses the
abnegation of his conscience, each man seeks the
indulgence of his private vice. And hence, in
Secret Societies (from which may yet proceed
great danger to all Europe), we find but foul and
hateful Eleusinia, affording pretexts to the ambition
of the great, to the license of the penniless,
to the passions of the revengeful, to the anarchy
of the ignorant. In a word, the societies of these
Italian Carbonari did but engender schemes in
which the abler chiefs disguised new forms of
despotism, and in which the revolutionary many
looked forward to the overthrow of all the institutions
that stand between Law and Chaos.
Naturally, therefore" (added L'Estrange, dryly),
"when their schemes were detected, and the conspiracy
foiled, it was for the silly honest men entrapped
into the league to suffer&mdash;the leaders
turned king's evidence, and the common mercenaries
became&mdash;banditti." Harley then proceeded
to state that it was just when the <i>soi-disant</i> Riccabocca
had discovered the true nature and ulterior
views of the conspirators he had joined, and
actually withdrawn from their councils, that he
was denounced by the kinsman who had duped
him into the enterprise, and who now profited by
his treason. Harley next spoke of the packet
dispatched by Riccabocca's dying wife, as it was
supposed to Mrs. Bertram; and of the hopes he
founded on the contents of that packet, if discovered.
He then referred to the design which had
brought Peschiera to England&mdash;a design which
that personage had avowed with such effrontery
to his companions at Vienna, that he had publicly
laid wagers on his success.</p>

<p>"But these men can know nothing of England&mdash;of
the safety of English laws," said Leonard,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_796" id="Page_796">[Pg 796]</a></span>
naturally. "We take it for granted that Riccabocca,
if I am still so to call him, refuses his consent
to the marriage between his daughter and
his foe. Where, then, the danger? This Count,
even if Violante were not under your mother's
roof, could not get an opportunity to see her. He
could not attack the house and carry her off like
a feudal baron in the middle ages."</p>

<p>"All this is very true," answered Harley.
"Yet I have found through life that we can not
estimate danger by external circumstances, but
by the character of those from whom it is threatened.
This Count is a man of singular audacity,
of no mean natural talents&mdash;talents practiced in
every art of duplicity and intrigue; one of those
men whose boast it is that they succeed in whatever
they undertake; and he is, here, urged on
the one hand by all that can whet the avarice,
and on the other by all that can give invention
to despair. Therefore, though I can not guess
what plan he may possibly adopt, I never doubt
that some plan, formed with cunning and pursued
with daring, will be embraced the moment he
discovers Violante's retreat, unless, indeed, we
can forestall all peril by the restoration of her
father, and the detection of the fraud and falsehood
to which Peschiera owes the fortune he appropriates.
Thus, while we must prosecute to
the utmost our inquiries for the missing documents,
so it should be our care to possess ourselves,
if possible, of such knowledge of the Count's
machinations as may enable us to defeat them.
Now, it was with satisfaction that I learned in
Germany that Peschiera's sister was in London.
I know enough both of his disposition and of the
intimacy between himself and this lady, to make
me think it probable he will seek to make her his
instrument, should he require one. Peschiera (as
you may suppose by his audacious wager) is not
one of those secret villains who would cut off
their right hand if it could betray the knowledge
of what was done by the left&mdash;rather one of those
self-confident, vaunting knaves, of high animal
spirits, and conscience so obtuse that it clouds
their intellect&mdash;who must have some one to whom
they can boast of their abilities and confide their
projects. And Peschiera has done all he can to
render this poor woman so wholly dependent on
him, as to be his slave and his tool. But I have
learned certain traits in her character that show
it to be impressionable to good, and with tendencies
to honor. Peschiera had taken advantage
of the admiration she excited some years ago, in
a rich young Englishman, to entice this admirer
into gambling, and sought to make his sister both
a decoy and an instrument in his designs of plunder.
She did not encourage the addresses of our
countryman, but she warned him of the snare
laid for him, and entreated him to leave the
place lest her brother should discover and punish
her honesty. The Englishman told me this himself.
In fine, my hope of detaching this poor
lady from Peschiera's interests, and inducing her
to forewarn us of his purpose, consists but in the
innocent, and, I hope, laudable artifice, of redeeming
herself&mdash;of appealing to, and calling
into disused exercise, the better springs of her
nature."</p>

<p>Leonard listened with admiration and some
surprise to the singularly subtle and sagacious
insight into character which Harley evinced in
the brief clear strokes by which he had thus depicted
Peschiera and Beatrice, and was struck by
the boldness with which Harley rested a whole
system of action upon a few deductions drawn
from his reasonings on human motive and characteristic
bias. Leonard had not expected to find
so much practical acuteness in a man who, however
accomplished, usually seemed indifferent,
dreamy, and abstracted to the ordinary things of
life. But Harley L'Estrange was one of those
whose powers lie dormant till circumstance applies
to them all they need for activity&mdash;the stimulant
of a motive.</p>

<p>Harley resumed: "After a conversation I had
with the lady last night, it occurred to me that
in this part of our diplomacy you could render us
essential service. Madame di Negra&mdash;such is the
sister's name&mdash;has conceived an admiration for
your genius, and a strong desire to know you
personally. I have promised to present you to
her; and I shall do so after a preliminary caution.
The lady is very handsome, and very fascinating.
It is possible that your heart and your
senses may not be proof against her attractions."</p>

<p>"Oh, do not fear that!" exclaimed Leonard,
with a tone of conviction so earnest that Harley
smiled.</p>

<p>"Forewarned is not always forearmed against
the might of Beauty, my dear Leonard; so I can
not at once accept your assurance. But listen to
me: Watch yourself narrowly, and if you find
that you are likely to be captivated, promise, on
your honor, to retreat at once from the field. I
have no right, for the sake of another, to expose
you to danger; and Madame di Negra, whatever
may be her good qualities, is the last person I
should wish to see you in love with."</p>

<p>"In love with her! Impossible!"</p>

<p>"Impossible is a strong word," returned Harley;
"still, I own fairly (and this belief also warrants
me in trusting you to her fascinations) that
I do think, as far as one man can judge of another,
that she is not the woman to attract you;
and, if filled by one pure and generous object in
your intercourse with her, you will see her with
purged eyes. Still I claim your promise as one
of honor."</p>

<p>"I give it," said Leonard, positively. "But
how can I serve Riccabocca? How aid in&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Thus," interrupted Harley: "The spell of
your writings is, that, unconsciously to ourselves
they make us better and nobler. And your writings
are but the impressions struck off from your
mind. Your conversation, when you are roused,
has the same effect. And as you grow more familiar
with Madame di Negra, I wish you to
speak of your boyhood, your youth. Describe the
exile as you have seen him&mdash;so touching amidst
his foibles, so grand amidst the petty privations<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_797" id="Page_797">[Pg 797]</a></span>
of his fallen fortunes, so benevolent while poring
over his hateful Machiavel, so stingless in his
wisdom of the serpent, so playfully astute in his
innocence of the dove&mdash;I leave the picture to
your knowledge of humor and pathos. Describe
Violante brooding over her Italian poets, and
filled with dreams of her father-land; describe
her with all the flashes of her princely nature,
shining forth through humble circumstance and
obscure position; awaken in your listener compassion,
respect, admiration for her kindred exiles&mdash;and
I think our work is done. She will recognize
evidently those whom her brother seeks.
She will question you closely where you met with
them&mdash;where they now are. Protect that secret:
say at once that it is not your own. Against
your descriptions and the feelings they excite, she
will not be guarded as against mine. And there
are other reasons why your influence over this
woman of mixed nature may be more direct and
effectual than my own."</p>

<p>"Nay, I can not conceive that."</p>

<p>"Believe it, without asking me to explain,"
answered Harley.</p>

<p>For he did not judge it necessary to say to
Leonard, "I am high-born and wealthy&mdash;you a
peasant's son, and living by your exertions. This
woman is ambitious and distressed. She might
have projects on me that would counteract mine
on her. You she would but listen to, and receive,
through the sentiments of good or of poetical that
are in her&mdash;you she would have no interest to
subjugate, no motive to ensnare."</p>

<p>"And now," said Harley, turning the subject,
"I have another object in view. This foolish
sage friend of ours, in his bewilderment and
fears, has sought to save Violante from one rogue
by promising her hand to a man who, unless my
instincts deceive me, I suspect much disposed to
be another. Sacrifice such exuberance of life and
spirit to that bloodless heart, to that cold and
earthward intellect! By Heavens, it shall not
be!"</p>

<p>"But whom can the exile possibly have seen
of birth and fortunes to render him a fitting
spouse for his daughter? Whom, my lord, except
yourself?"</p>

<p>"Me!" exclaimed Harley, angrily, and changing
color. "I worthy of such a creature? I&mdash;with
my habits! I&mdash;silken egotist that I am!
And you, a poet, to form such an estimate of one
who might be the queen of a poet's dream!"</p>

<p>"My lord, when we sate the other night round
Riccabocca's hearth&mdash;when I heard her speak,
and observed you listen, I said to myself, from
such knowledge of human nature as comes, we
know not how, to us poets&mdash;I said, 'Harley
L'Estrange has looked long and wistfully on the
heavens, and he now hears the murmur of the
wings that can waft him toward them.' And
then I sighed, for I thought how the world rules
us all in spite of ourselves. And I said, 'What
pity for both, that the exile's daughter is not the
worldly equal of the peer's son!' And you, too,
sighed, as I thus thought; and I fancied that,
while you listened to the music of the wing, you
felt the iron of the chain. But the exile's daughter
is your equal in birth, and you are hers in
heart and in soul."</p>

<p>"My poor Leonard, you rave," answered Harley,
calmly. "And if Violante is not to be some
young prince's bride, she should be some young
poet's."</p>

<p>"Poet's! Oh, no!" said Leonard, with a gentle
laugh. "Poets need repose where <i>they</i> love!"</p>

<p>Harley was struck by the answer, and mused
over it in silence. "I comprehend," thought he;
"it is a new light that dawns on me. What is
needed by the man whose whole life is one strain
after glory&mdash;whose soul sinks, in fatigue, to the
companionship of earth&mdash;is not the love of a nature
like his own. He is right&mdash;it is repose!
While I, it is true! Boy that he is, his intuitions
are wiser than all my experience! It <i>is</i> excitement&mdash;energy&mdash;elevation,
that Love should
bestow on me. But I have chosen; and, at
least, with Helen my life will be calm, and my
hearth sacred. Let the rest sleep in the same
grave as my youth."</p>

<p>"But," said Leonard, wishing kindly to arouse
his noble friend from a reverie which he felt was
mournful, though he did not divine its true cause&mdash;"but
you have not yet told me the name of the
Signora's suitor. May I know?"</p>

<p>"Probably one you never heard of. Randal
Leslie&mdash;a placeman. You refused a place; you
were right."</p>

<p>"Randal Leslie? Heaven forbid!" cried Leonard,
revealing his surprise at the name.</p>

<p>"Amen! But what do you know of him?"</p>

<p>Leonard related the story of Burley's pamphlet.</p>

<p>Harley seemed delighted to hear his suspicions
of Randal confirmed. "The paltry pretender!
and yet I fancied that he might be formidable!
However we must dismiss him for the present;
we are approaching Madame di Negra's house.
Prepare yourself, and remember your promise!"</p>


<h3>CHAPTER XIII.</h3>

<p>Some days have passed by. Leonard and Beatrice
di Negra have already made friends. Harley
is satisfied with his young friend's report. He
himself has been actively occupied. He has
sought, but hitherto in vain, all trace of Mrs.
Bertram; he has put that investigation into
the hands of his lawyer, and his lawyer has not
been more fortunate than himself. Moreover,
Harley has blazed forth again in the London
world, and promises again <i>de faire fureur</i>; but
he has always found time to spend some hours
in the twenty-four at his father's house. He has
continued much the same tone with Violante,
and she begins to accustom herself to it, and reply
saucily. His calm courtship to Helen flows
on in silence. Leonard, too, has been a frequent
guest at the Lansmeres': all welcome and like
him there. Peschiera has not evinced any sign
of the deadly machinations ascribed to him. He
goes less into the drawing-room world: he meets<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_798" id="Page_798">[Pg 798]</a></span>
Lord L'Estrange there; and brilliant and handsome
though Peschiera be, Lord L'Estrange, like
Rob Roy Mac-Gregor, is "on his native heath,"
and has the decided advantage over the foreigner.
Peschiera, however, shines in the clubs, and
plays high. Still scarcely an evening passes in
which he and Baron Levy do not meet.</p>

<p>Audley Egerton has been intensely occupied
with affairs. Only seen once by Harley. Harley
then was about to deliver himself of his sentiments
respecting Randal Leslie, and to communicate
the story of Burley and the pamphlet. Egerton
stopped him short.</p>

<p>"My dear Harley, don't try to set me against
this young man. I wish to hear nothing in his
disfavor. In the first place, it would not alter the
line of conduct I mean to adopt with regard to
him. He is my wife's kinsman; I charged myself
with his career, as a wish of hers, and therefore
as a duty to myself. In attaching him so
young to my own fate, I drew him necessarily
away from the professions in which his industry
and talents (for he has both in no common degree)
would have secured his fortunes; therefore,
be he bad, be he good, I shall try to provide for
him as I best can; and, moreover, cold as I am
to him, and worldly though perhaps he be, I have
somehow or other conceived an interest in him&mdash;a
liking to him. He has been under my roof,
he is dependent on me; he has been docile and
prudent, and I am a lone, childless man; therefore,
spare him, since in so doing you spare me;
and ah, Harley, I have so many cares on me <i>now</i>,
that&mdash;"</p>

<p>"O, say no more, my dear, dear Audley," cried
the generous friend; "how little people know
you!"</p>

<p>Audley's hand trembled. Certainly his nerves
began to show wear and tear.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the object of this dialogue&mdash;the
type of perverted intellect&mdash;of mind without heart&mdash;of
knowledge which had no aim but power&mdash;was
in a state of anxious perturbed gloom. He
did not know whether wholly to believe Levy's
assurance of his patron's ruin. He could not believe
it when he saw that great house in Grosvenor-square,
its hall crowded with lackeys, its
sideboard blazing with plate; when no dun was
ever seen in the ante-chamber; when not a tradesman
was ever known to call twice for a bill. He
hinted to Levy the doubts all these phenomena
suggested to him; but the Baron only smiled
ominously, and said&mdash;</p>

<p>"True, the tradesmen are always paid; but
the how is the question! Randal, <i>mon cher</i>, you
are too innocent. I have but two pieces of advice
to suggest, in the shape of two proverbs&mdash;'Wise
rats run from a falling house,' and 'Make hay
while the sun shines.' Apropos, Mr. Avenel likes
you greatly, and has been talking of the borough
of Lansmere for you. He has contrived to get
together a great interest there.' Make much of
him."</p>

<p>Randal had indeed been to Mrs. Avenel's <i>soir&eacute;e
dansante</i>, and called twice and found her at home,
and been very bland and civil, and admired the
children. She had two, a boy and a girl, very
like their father, with open faces as bold as brass.
And as all this had won Mrs. Avenel's good
graces, so it had propitiated her husband's. Avenel
was shrewd enough to see how clever Randal
was. He called him "smart," and said, "he
would have got on in America," which was the
highest praise Dick Avenel ever accorded to any
man. But Dick himself looked a little care-worn;
and this was the first year in which he had murmured
at the bills of his wife's dressmaker, and
said with an oath, that "there was such a thing
as going <i>too</i> much ahead."</p>

<p>Randal had visited Dr. Riccabocca, had found
Violante flown. True to his promise to Harley,
the Italian refused to say where, and suggested,
as was agreed, that for the present it would be
more prudent if Randal suspended his visits to
himself. Leslie, not liking this proposition, attempted
to make himself still necessary, by working
on Riccabocca's fears as to that espionage on
his retreat, which had been among the reasons
that had hurried the sage into offering Randal
Violante's hand. But Riccabocca had already
learned that the fancied spy was but his neighbor
Leonard; and, without so saying, he cleverly contrived
to make the supposition of such espionage
an additional reason for the cessation of Leslie's
visits. Randal, then, in his own artful, quiet,
roundabout way, had sought to find out if any
communication had passed between L'Estrange
and Riccabocca. Brooding over Harley's words
to him, he suspected there had been such communication,
with his usual penetrating astuteness.
Riccabocca, here, was less on his guard,
and rather parried the sidelong questions than
denied their inferences.</p>

<p>Randal began already to surmise the truth.
Where was it likely Violante should go but to the
Lansmeres'? This confirmed his idea of Harley's
pretensions to her hand. With such a rival what
chance had he? Randal never doubted for a moment
that the pupil of Machiavel would "throw
him over," if such an alliance to his daughter
really presented itself. The schemer at once discarded
from his project all further aim on Violante;
either she would be poor, and he would not
have her; or she would be rich, and her father
would give her to another. As his heart had
never been touched by the fair Italian, so the moment
her inheritance became more than doubtful,
it gave him no pang to lose her; but he did feel
very sore and resentful at the thought of being
supplanted by Lord L'Estrange, the man who had
insulted him.</p>

<p>Neither, as yet, had Randal made any way in
his designs on Frank. For several days Madame
di Negra had not been at home, either to himself
or young Hazeldean; and Frank, though very unhappy,
was piqued and angry; and Randal suspected,
and suspected, and suspected, he knew not
exactly what, but that the devil was not so kind
to him there as that father of lies ought to have
been to a son so dutiful. Yet, with all these discouragements,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_799" id="Page_799">[Pg 799]</a></span>
there was in Randal Leslie so dogged
and determined a conviction of his own success&mdash;there
was so great a tenacity of purpose
under obstacles, and so vigilant an eye upon all
chances that could be turned to his favor, that he
never once abandoned hope, nor did more than
change the details in his main schemes. Out of
calculations apparently the most far-fetched and
improbable, he had constructed a patient policy,
to which he obstinately clung. How far his reasonings
and patience served to his ends, remains
yet to be seen. But could our contempt for the
baseness of Randal himself be separated from the
faculties which he elaborately degraded to the
service of that baseness, one might allow there
was something one could scarcely despise in this
still self-reliance, this inflexible resolve. Had such
qualities, aided as they were by abilities of no ordinary
acuteness, been applied to objects commonly
honest, one would have backed Randal
Leslie against any fifty picked prizemen from the
colleges. But there are judges of weight and
metal, who do that now, especially Baron Levy,
who says to himself as he eyes that pale face all
intellect, and that spare form all nerve, "That is
a man who must make way in life; he is worth
helping."</p>

<p>By the words "worth helping," Baron Levy
meant "worth getting into my power, that he
may help me."</p>


<h3>CHAPTER XIV.</h3>

<p>But Parliament had met. Events that belong
to history had contributed yet more to weaken the
administration. Randal Leslie's interest became
absorbed in politics; for the stake to him was his
whole political career. Should Audley lose office,
and for good, Audley could aid him no more; but
to abandon his patron, as Levy recommended, and
pin himself, in the hope of a seat in Parliament,
to a stranger&mdash;an obscure stranger, like Dick
Avenel&mdash;that was a policy not to be adopted at a
breath. Meanwhile, almost every night, when
the House met, that pale face and spare form,
which Levy so identified with shrewdness and
energy, might be seen among the benches appropriated
to those more select strangers who obtained
the Speaker's order of admission. There
Randal heard the great men of that day, and with
the half contemptuous surprise at their fame,
which is common enough among clever, well-educated
young men, who know not what it is to
speak in the House of Commons. He heard much
slovenly English, much trite reasoning, some eloquent
thoughts, and close argument, often delivered
in a jerking tone of voice (popularly called
the parliamentary <i>twang</i>), and often accompanied
by gesticulations that would have shocked the
manager of a provincial theatre. He thought
how much better than these great dons (with but
one or two exceptions) he himself could speak&mdash;with
what more refined logic&mdash;with what more
polished periods&mdash;how much more like Cicero and
Burke! Very probably he might have so spoken,
and for that very reason have made that deadest
of all dead failures&mdash;an excellent spoken essay.
One thing, however, he was obliged to own, viz.,
that in a popular representative assembly it is
not precisely knowledge that is power, or if knowledge,
it is but the knowledge of that particular
assembly, and what will best take with it;&mdash;passion,
invective, sarcasm, bold declamation, shrewd
common sense, the readiness so rarely found in a
very profound mind&mdash;he owned that all these
were the qualities that told; when a man who exhibited
nothing but "knowledge," in the ordinary
sense of the word, stood in imminent chance of
being coughed down.</p>

<p>There at his left&mdash;last but one in the row of the
ministerial chiefs&mdash;Randal watched Audley Egerton,
his arms folded on his breast, his hat drawn
over his brows, his eyes fixed with steady courage
on whatever speaker in the Opposition held possession
of the floor. And twice Randal heard
Egerton speak, and marveled much at the effect
that minister produced. For of those qualities
enumerated above, and which Randal had observed
to be most sure of success, Audley Egerton
only exhibited to a marked degree&mdash;the common
sense, and the readiness. And yet, though but
little applauded by noisy cheers, no speaker seemed
more to satisfy friends, and command respect
from foes. The true secret was this, which Randal
might well not divine, since that young person,
despite his ancient birth, his Eton rearing,
and his refined air, was not one of Nature's gentlemen;&mdash;the
true secret was, that Audley Egerton
moved, looked, and spoke, like a thorough
gentleman of England. A gentleman of more
than average talents and of long experience,
speaking his sincere opinions&mdash;not a rhetorician
aiming at effect. Moreover, Egerton was a consummate
man of the world. He said, with nervous
simplicity, what his party desired to be said,
and put what his opponents felt to be the strong
points of the case. Calm and decorous, yet spirited
and energetic, with little variety of tone, and
action subdued and rare, but yet signalized by
earnest vigor, Audley Egerton impressed the understanding
of the dullest, and pleased the taste
of the most fastidious.</p>

<p>But once, when allusions were made to a certain
popular question, on which the premier had
announced his resolution to refuse all concession,
and on the expediency of which it was announced
that the cabinet was nevertheless divided&mdash;and
when such allusions were coupled with direct
appeals to Mr. Egerton, as "the enlightened
member of a great commercial constituency," and
with a flattering doubt that "that right honorable
gentleman, member for that great city, identified
with the cause of the Burgher class, could be so
far behind the spirit of the age as his official
chief,"&mdash;Randal observed that Egerton drew his
hat still more closely over his brows and turned
to whisper with one of his colleagues. He could
not be <i>got up</i> to speak.</p>

<p>That evening Randal walked home with Egerton,
and intimated his surprise that the minister
had declined what seemed to him a good occasion<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_800" id="Page_800">[Pg 800]</a></span>
for one of those brief, weighty replies by which
Audley was chiefly distinguished, an occasion to
which he had been loudly invited by the "hears"
of the House.</p>

<p>"Leslie," answered the statesman briefly, "I
owe all my success in Parliament to this rule&mdash;I
have never spoken against my convictions. I intend
to abide by it to the last."</p>

<p>"But if the question at issue comes before the
House you will vote against it?"</p>

<p>"Certainly, I vote as a member of the cabinet.
But since I am not leader and mouthpiece of the
party, I retain the privilege to speak as an individual."</p>

<p>"Ah, my dear Mr. Egerton," exclaimed Randal,
"forgive me. But this question, right or
wrong, has got such hold of the public mind.
So little, if conceded in time, would give content;
and it is so clear (if I may judge by the talk I
hear every where I go) that, by refusing all concession,
the government must fall, that I wish&mdash;"</p>

<p>"So do I wish," interrupted Egerton, with a
gloomy impatient sigh&mdash;"so do I wish! But
what avails it? If my advice had been taken
but three weeks ago&mdash;now it is too late&mdash;we could
have doubled the rock; we refused, we must split
upon it."</p>

<p>This speech was so unlike the discreet and reserved
minister, that Randal gathered courage to
proceed with an idea that had occurred to his
own sagacity. And before I state it, I must add
that Egerton had of late shown much more personal
kindness to his <i>prot&eacute;g&eacute;</i>; that, whether his
spirits were broken, or that at last, close and compact
as his nature of bronze was, he felt the imperious
want to groan aloud in some loving ear,
the stern Audley seemed tamed and softened. So
Randal went on.</p>

<p>"May I say what I have heard expressed with
regard to you and your position&mdash;in the streets&mdash;in
the clubs?"</p>

<p>"Yes, it is in the streets and the clubs, that
statesmen should go to school. Say on."</p>

<p>"Well, then, I have heard it made a matter
of wonder why you, and one or two others I will
not name, do not at once retire from the ministry,
and on the avowed ground that you side
with the public feeling on this irresistible question."</p>

<p>"Eh!"</p>

<p>"It is clear that in so doing you would become
the most popular man in the country&mdash;clear that
you would be summoned back to power on the
shoulders of the people. No new cabinet could
be formed without you, and your station in it
would perhaps be higher, for life, than that which
you may now retain but for a few weeks longer.
Has not this ever occurred to you?"</p>

<p>"Never," said Audley, with dry composure.</p>

<p>Amazed at such obtuseness, Randal exclaimed,
"Is it possible! And yet, forgive me if I say
I think you are ambitious and love power."</p>

<p>"No man more ambitious; and if by power
you mean office, it has grown the habit of my
life, and I shall not know how to do without
it."</p>

<p>"And how, then, has what seems to me so
obvious never occurred to you?"</p>

<p>"Because you are young, and therefore I forgive
you; but not the gossips who could wonder
why Audley Egerton refused to betray the friends
of his whole career, and to profit by the treason."</p>

<p>"But one should love one's country before a
party."</p>

<p>"No doubt of that; and the first interest of a
country is the honor of its public men."</p>

<p>"But men may leave their party without dishonor!"</p>

<p>"Who doubts that? Do you suppose that if
I were an ordinary independent member of Parliament,
loaded with no obligations, charged with
no trust, I could hesitate for a moment what
course to pursue? Oh, that I were but the member
for &mdash;&mdash;! Oh! that I had the full right to
be a free agent! But if a member of a cabinet,
a chief in whom thousands confide, because he is
outvoted in a council of his colleagues, suddenly
retires, and by so doing breaks up the whole party
whose confidence he has enjoyed, whose rewards
he has reaped, to whom he owes the very
position which he employs to their ruin&mdash;own
that though his choice may be honest, it is one
which requires all the consolations of conscience."</p>

<p>"But you will have those consolations. And,"
added Randal energetically, "the gain to your
career will be immense!"</p>

<p>"That is precisely what it can not be," answered
Egerton, gloomily. "I grant that I may,
if I choose, resign office with the present government,
and so at once destroy that government;
for my resignation on such ground would suffice
to do it. I grant this; but for that very reason
I could not the next day take office with another
administration. I could not accept wages for
desertion. No gentleman could! And, therefore&mdash;"
Audley stopped short, and he buttoned
his coat over his broad breast. The action was
significant: it said that the man's mind was
made up.</p>

<p>In fact, whether Audley Egerton was right or
wrong in his theory depends upon much subtler,
and perhaps loftier views in the casuistry of political
duties, than it was in his character to take.
And I guard myself from saying any thing in
praise or disfavor of his notions, or implying that
he is a fit or unfit example in a parallel case. I
am but describing the man as he was, and as a
man like him would inevitably be, under the influences
in which he lived, and in that peculiar
world of which he was so emphatically a member.
"<i>Ce n'est pas moi qui parle, c'est Marc
Aur&egrave;le.</i>"</p>

<p>He speaks, not I.</p>

<p>Randal had no time for further discussion
They now reached Egerton's house, and the minister,
taking the chamber candlestick from his
servant's hand, nodded a silent good-night to
Leslie, and with a jaded look retired to his room.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_801" id="Page_801">[Pg 801]</a></span></p>


<h3>CHAPTER XV.</h3>

<p>But not on the threatened question was that
eventful campaign of Party decided. The government
fell less in battle than skirmish. It was
one fatal Monday&mdash;a dull question of finance and
figures. Prosy and few were the speakers. All
the government silent, save the Chancellor of the
Exchequer, and another business-like personage
connected with the Board of Trade, whom the
House would hardly condescend to hear. The
House was in no mood to think of facts and
figures. Early in the evening, between nine
and ten, the Speaker's sonorous voice sounded,
"Strangers must withdraw!" And Randal,
anxious and foreboding, descended from his seat,
and went out of the fatal doors. He turned to
take a last glance at Audley Egerton. The
whipper-in was whispering to Audley; and the
minister pushed back his hat from his brows, and
glanced round the house, and up into the galleries,
as if to calculate rapidly the relative numbers of
the two armies in the field; then he smiled bitterly,
and threw himself back into his seat. That
smile long haunted Leslie.</p>

<p>Among the strangers thus banished with Randal,
while the division was being taken, were
many young men, like himself, connected with
the administration&mdash;some by blood, some by
place. Hearts beat loud in the swarming lobbies.
Ominous mournful whispers were exchanged.
"They say the government will have a majority
of ten." "No; I hear they will certainly be
beaten." "H&mdash;&mdash; says by fifty." "I don't
believe it," said a Lord of the Bedchamber; "it's
impossible. I left government members dining
at the 'Travelers.'" "No one thought the division
would be so early." "A trick of the Whigs&mdash;shameful."
"Wonder some one was not set
up to talk for time; very odd P&mdash;&mdash; did not
speak; however, he is so cursedly rich, he does
not care whether he is out or in." "Yes; and
Audley Egerton, too, just such another; glad, no
doubt, to be set free to look after his property;
very different tactics if we had men to whom office
was as necessary as it is&mdash;to me!" said a
candid, young placeman. Suddenly the silent
Leslie felt a friendly grasp on his arm. He turned,
and saw Levy.</p>

<p>"Did I not tell you?" said the Baron, with an
exulting smile.</p>

<p>"You are sure, then, that the government will
be outvoted?"</p>

<p>"I spent the morning in going over the list of
members with a parliamentary client of mine,
who knows them all as a shepherd does his sheep.
Majority for the Opposition at least twenty-five."</p>

<p>"And in that case, must the government resign,
sir?" asked the candid young placeman,
who had been listening to the smart well-dressed
Baron, "his soul planted in his ears."</p>

<p>"Of course, sir," replied the Baron, blandly,
and offering his snuff-box (true Louis Quinze,
with a miniature of Madame de Pompadour, set
in pearls). "You are a friend to the present
ministers? You could not wish them to be mean
enough to stay in?" Randal drew aside the
Baron.</p>

<p>"If Audley's affairs are as you state, what
can he do?"</p>

<p>"I shall ask him that question to-morrow,"
answered the Baron, with a look of visible hate.
"And I have come here just to see how he bears
the prospect before him."</p>

<p>"You will not discover that in his face. And
those absurd scruples of his! If he had but gone
out in time&mdash;to come in again with the New
Men!"</p>

<p>"Oh, of course, our Right Honorable is too
punctilious for that!" answered the Baron, sneering.</p>

<p>Suddenly the doors opened&mdash;in rushed the
breathless expectants. "What are the numbers?
What is the division!"</p>

<p>"Majority against ministers," said a member
of Opposition, peeling an orange, "twenty-nine."</p>

<p>The Baron, too, had a Speaker's order; and he
came into the House with Randal, and sate by
his side. But, to their disgust, some member
was talking about the other motions before the
House.</p>

<p>"What! has nothing been said as to the division?"
asked the Baron of a young county member,
who was talking to some non-parliamentary
friend in the bench before Levy. The county member
was one of the Baron's pet eldest sons&mdash;had
dined often with Levy&mdash;was under "obligations"
to him. The young legislator looked very much
ashamed of Levy's friendly pat on his shoulder,
and answered hurriedly, "Oh, yes; H&mdash;&mdash; asked,
'if, after such an expression of the House, it was
the intention of ministers to retain their places,
and carry on the business of the government?'"</p>

<p>"Just like H&mdash;&mdash;! Very inquisitive mind!
And what was the answer he got?"</p>

<p>"None," said the county member; and returned
in haste to his proper seat in the body of
the House.</p>

<p>"There comes Egerton," said the Baron. And,
indeed, as most of the members were now leaving
the House, to talk over affairs at clubs or in
saloons, and spread through town the great tidings,
Audley Egerton's tall head was seen towering
above the rest. And Levy turned away disappointed.
For not only was the minister's handsome
face, though pale, serene and cheerful, but
there was an obvious courtesy, a marked respect,
in the mode in which that rough assembly made
way for the fallen minister as he passed through
the jostling crowd. And the frank urbane nobleman,
who afterward, from the force, not of talent,
but of character, became the leader in the House,
pressed the hand of his old opponent, as they
met in the throng near the doors, and said aloud,
"I shall not be a proud man if ever I live to have
office; but I shall be proud if ever I leave it with
as little to be said against me as your bitterest
opponents can say against you, Egerton."</p>

<p>"I wonder," exclaimed the Baron, aloud, and
leaning over the partition that divided him from
the throng below, so that his voice reached Egerton&mdash;and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_802" id="Page_802">[Pg 802]</a></span>
there was a cry from formal, indignant
members, "Order in the strangers' gallery!"&mdash;"I
wonder what Lord L'Estrange will say!"</p>

<p>Audley lifted his dark brows, surveyed the
Baron for an instant with flashing eyes, then
walked down the narrow defile between the last
benches, and vanished from the scene in which,
alas! so few of the most admired performers
leave more than an actor's short-lived name!</p>


<h3>CHAPTER XVI.</h3>

<p>Baron Levy did not execute his threat of calling
on Egerton the next morning. Perhaps he
shrank from again meeting the flash of those indignant
eyes. And, indeed, Egerton was too
busied all the forenoon to see any one not upon
public affairs, except Harley, who hastened to
console or cheer him. When the House met, it
was announced that the ministers had resigned,
only holding their offices till their successors were
appointed. But already there was some reaction
in their favor; and when it became generally
known that the new administration was to be
formed of men, few, indeed, of whom had ever
before held office&mdash;that common superstition in
the public mind, that government is like a trade,
in which a regular apprenticeship must be served,
began to prevail; and the talk at the clubs was,
that the new men could not stand; that the former
ministry, with some modification, would be
back in a month. Perhaps that, too, might be
a reason why Baron Levy thought it prudent not
prematurely to offer vindictive condolences to
Mr. Egerton. Randal spent part of his morning
in inquiries, as to what gentleman in his situation
meant to do with regard to their places; he
heard with great satisfaction that very few intended
to volunteer retirement from their desks.
As Randal himself had observed to Egerton,
"their country before their party!"</p>

<p>Randal's place was of great moment to him;
its duties were easy, its salary amply sufficient
for his wants, and defrayed such expenses as
were bestowed on the education of Oliver and
his sister. For I am bound to do justice to this
young man&mdash;indifferent as he was toward his
species in general, the ties of family were strong
with him; and he stinted himself in many temptations
most alluring to his age, in the endeavor
to raise the dull honest Oliver and the loose-haired
pretty Juliet somewhat more to his own level
of culture and refinement. Men essentially griping
and unscrupulous, often do make the care
for their family an apology for their sins against
the world. Even Richard III., if the chroniclers
are to be trusted, excused the murder of his
nephews by his passionate affection for his son.
With the loss of that place, Randal lost all means
of support, save what Audley could give him;
and if Audley were in truth ruined? Moreover,
Randal had already established at the office a
reputation for ability and industry. It was a
career in which, if he abstained from party politics,
he might rise to a fair station and to a considerable
income. Therefore, much contented
with what he learned as to the general determination
of his fellow officials, a determination
warranted by ordinary precedent in such cases,
Randal dined at a club with good relish, and
much Christian resignation for the reverse of his
patron, and then walked to Grosvenor-square, on
the chance of finding Audley within. Learning
that he was so, from the porter who opened the
door, Randal entered the library. Three gentlemen
were seated there with Egerton: one of the
three was Lord L'Estrange; the other two were
members of the really defunct, though nominally
still existing, government. He was about to
withdraw from intruding on this conclave, when
Egerton said to him gently, "Come in, Leslie;
I was just speaking about yourself."</p>

<p>"About me, sir?"</p>

<p>"Yes; about you and the place you hold. I
had asked Sir &mdash;&mdash; (pointing to a fellow minister)
whether I might not, with propriety, request
your chief to leave some note of his opinion of
your talents, which I know is high, and which
might serve you with his successor."</p>

<p>"Oh, sir, at such a time to think of me!" exclaimed
Randal, and he was genuinely touched.</p>

<p>"But," resumed Audley with his usual dryness,
"Sir &mdash;&mdash;, to my surprise, thinks that it would
better become you that you should resign. Unless
his reasons, which he has not stated, are
very strong, such would not be my advice."</p>

<p>"My reasons," said Sir &mdash;&mdash;, with official formality,
"are simply these: I have a nephew in
a similar situation; he will resign, as a matter
of course. Every one in the public offices whose
relatives and near connections hold high appointments
in the government, will do so. I do not
think Mr. Leslie will like to feel himself a solitary
exception."</p>

<p>"Mr. Leslie is no relation of mine&mdash;not even a
near connection," answered Egerton.</p>

<p>"But his name is so associated with your own&mdash;he
has resided so long in your house&mdash;is so
well known in society (and don't think I compliment
when I add, that we hope so well of him),
that I can't think it worth his while to keep this
paltry place, which incapacitates him too from a
seat in parliament."</p>

<p>Sir &mdash;&mdash; was one of those terribly rich men,
to whom all considerations of mere bread and
cheese are paltry. But I must add, that he supposed
Egerton to be still wealthier than himself,
and sure to provide handsomely for Randal, whom
Sir &mdash;&mdash; rather liked than not; and, for Randal's
own sake, Sir &mdash;&mdash; thought it would lower him
in the estimation of Egerton himself, despite that
gentleman's advocacy, if he did not follow the
example of his avowed and notorious patron.</p>

<p>"You see, Leslie," said Egerton, checking
Randal's meditated reply, "that nothing can be
said against your honor if you stay where you
are; it is a mere question of expediency; I will
judge that for you; keep your place."</p>

<p>Unhappily the other member of the government,
who had hitherto been silent, was a literary
man. Unhappily, while this talk had proceeded,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_803" id="Page_803">[Pg 803]</a></span>
he had placed his hand upon Randal Leslie's
celebrated pamphlet, which lay on the library
table; and, turning over the leaves, the whole
spirit and matter of that masterly composition in
defense of the administration (a composition steeped
in all the essence of party) recurred to his too
faithful recollection. He, too, liked Randal; he
did more&mdash;he admired the author of that striking
and effective pamphlet. And, therefore, rousing
himself from the sublime indifference he had before
felt for the fate of a subaltern, he said with
a bland and complimentary smile, "No; the
writer of this most able publication is no ordinary
placeman. His opinions here are too vigorously
stated; this fine irony on the very person who in
all probability will be the chief in his office, has
excited too lively an attention, to allow him the
<i>sedet eternumque sedebit</i> on an official stool. Ha,
ha! this is so good! Read it, L'Estrange. What
say you?"</p>

<p>Harley glanced over the page pointed out to
him. The original was in one of Burley's broad,
coarse, but telling burlesques, strained fine through
Randal's more polished satire. It was capital.
Harley smiled, and lifted his eyes to Randal.
The unlucky plagiarist's face was flushed&mdash;the
beads stood on his brow. Harley was a good
hater; he loved too warmly not to err on the
opposite side; but he was one of those men who
forget hate when its object is distressed and humbled.
He put down the pamphlet and said, "I
am no politician; but Egerton is so well known
to be fastidious and over scrupulous in all points
of official etiquette, that Mr. Leslie can not follow
a safer counselor."</p>

<p>"Read that yourself, Egerton," said Sir &mdash;&mdash;;
and he pushed the pamphlet to Audley.</p>

<p>Now Egerton had a dim recollection that that
pamphlet was unlucky; but he had skimmed
over its contents hastily, and at that moment had
forgotten all about it. He took up the too famous
work with a reluctant hand, but he read attentively
the passages pointed out to him, and then
said, gravely and sadly,</p>

<p>"Mr. Leslie, I retract my advice. I believe
Sir &mdash;&mdash; is right; that the nobleman here so
keenly satirized will be chief in your office. I
doubt whether he will not compel your dismissal;
at all events, he could scarcely be expected to
promote your advancement. Under the circumstances,
I fear you have no option as a&mdash;"
Egerton paused a moment, and, with a sigh that
appeared to settle the question, concluded with&mdash;"as
a gentleman."</p>

<p>Never did Jack Cade, never did Wat Tyler,
feel a more deadly hate to that word "gentleman,"
than the well-born Leslie felt then; but
he bowed his head, and answered with his usual
presence of mind&mdash;</p>

<p>"You utter my own sentiment."</p>

<p>"You think we are right, Harley?" asked
Egerton, with an irresolution that surprised all
present.</p>

<p>"I think," answered Harley, with a compassion
for Randal that was almost over generous,
and yet with an <i>&eacute;quivoque</i> on the words despite
the compassion&mdash;"I think whoever has served
Audley Egerton never yet has been a loser by it;
and if Mr. Leslie wrote this pamphlet, he must
have well served Audley Egerton. If he undergoes
the penalty, we may safely trust to Egerton
for the compensation."</p>

<p>"My compensation has long since been made,"
answered Randal, with grace; "and that Mr.
Egerton could thus have cared for my fortunes,
at an hour so occupied, is a thought of pride
which&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Enough, Leslie! enough!" interrupted Egerton,
rising and pressing his <i>prot&eacute;g&eacute;'s</i> hands.
"See me before you go to bed."</p>

<p>Then the two other ministers rose also, and
shook hands with Leslie, and told him he had
done the right thing, and that they hoped soon
to see him in parliament; and hinted smilingly,
that the next administration did not promise to
be very long-lived; and one asked him to dinner,
and the other to spend a week at his country
seat. And amidst these congratulations at the
stroke that left him penniless, the distinguished
pamphleteer left the room. How he cursed big
John Burley!</p>


<h3>CHAPTER XVII.</h3>

<p>It was past midnight when Audley Egerton
summoned Randal. The statesman was then
alone, seated before his great desk, with its manifold
compartments, and engaged on the task of
transferring various papers and letters, some to
the waste-basket, some to the flames, some to two
great iron chests with patent locks that stood
open-mouthed, at his feet. Strong, stern, and
grim they looked, silently receiving the relics of
power departed; strong, stern, and grim as the
grave. Audley lifted his eyes at Randal's entrance,
signed to him to take a chair, continued
his task for a few moments, and then turning
round, as if with an effort he plucked himself
from his master passion&mdash;Public Life&mdash;he said,
with deliberate tones&mdash;</p>

<p>"I know not, Randal Leslie, whether you
thought me needlessly cautious, or wantonly unkind,
when I told you never to expect from me
more than such advance to your career as my
then position could effect&mdash;never to expect from
my liberality in life, nor from my testament in
death&mdash;an addition to your private fortunes. I
see by your gesture what would be your reply,
and I thank you for it. I now tell you, as yet
in confidence, though before long it can be no
secret to the world, that my pecuniary affairs
have been so neglected by me, in my devotion to
those of the state, that I am somewhat like the
man who portioned out his capital at so much a
day, calculating to live just long enough to make
it last. Unfortunately he lived too long." Audley
smiled&mdash;but the smile was cold as a sunbeam
upon ice&mdash;and went on with the same firm, unfaltering
accents: "The prospects that face me
I am prepared for; they do not take me by surprise.
I knew long since how this would end, if<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_804" id="Page_804">[Pg 804]</a></span>
I survived the loss of office. I knew it before
you came to me, and therefore I spoke to you as
I did, judging it manful and right to guard you
against hopes which you might otherwise have
naturally entertained. On this head I need say
no more. It may excite your surprise, possibly
your blame, that I, esteemed methodical and
practical enough in the affairs of the state, should
be so imprudent as to my own."</p>

<p>"Oh, sir! you owe no account to me."</p>

<p>"To you, at least, as much as to any one. I
am a solitary man; my few relations need nothing
from me. I had a right to spend what I
possessed as I pleased, and if I have spent it
recklessly as regards myself, I have not spent it
ill in its effect on others. It has been my object
for many years to have no <i>Private Life</i>&mdash;to dispense
with its sorrows, joys, affection; and as to
its duties, they did not exist for me. I have
said." Mechanically, as he ended, the minister's
hand closed the lid of one of the iron boxes, and
on the closed lid he rested his firm foot. "But
now," he resumed, "I have failed to advance
your career. True, I warned you that you drew
into a lottery; but you had more chance of a
prize than a blank. A blank, however, it has
turned out, and the question becomes grave&mdash;What
are you to do?"</p>

<p>Here, seeing that Egerton came to a full pause,
Randal answered readily:</p>

<p>"Still, sir, to go by your advice."</p>

<p>"My advice," said Audley, with a softened
look, "would perhaps be rude and unpalatable.
I would rather place before you an option. On
the one hand, recommence life again. I told
you that I would keep your name on your college
books. You can return&mdash;you can take your degree&mdash;after
that, you can go to the bar&mdash;you
have just the talents calculated to succeed in
that profession. Success will be slow, it is true;
but, with perseverance, it will be sure. And,
believe me, Leslie, Ambition is only sweet while
it is but the loftier name for Hope. Who would
care for a fox's brush, if it had not been rendered
a prize by the excitement of the chase?"</p>

<p>"Oxford&mdash;again! It is a long step back in
life," said Randal, drearily; and little heeding
Egerton's unusual indulgence of illustration.
"A long step back&mdash;and to what? To a profession
in which one never begins to rise till
one's hair is gray! Besides, how live in the
mean while?"</p>

<p>"Do not let that thought disturb you. The
modest income that suffices for a student at the
bar, I trust, at least, to insure you from the
wrecks of my fortune."</p>

<p>"Ah, sir, I would not burthen you further.
What right have I to such kindness, save my
name of Leslie?" And in spite of himself, as
Randal concluded, a tone of bitterness, that betrayed
reproach, broke forth. Egerton was too
much the man of the world not to comprehend
the reproach, and not to pardon it.</p>

<p>"Certainly," he answered, calmly, "as a Leslie
you are entitled to my consideration, and
would have been entitled perhaps to more, had
I not so explicitly warned you to the contrary
But the bar does not seem to please you?"</p>

<p>"What is the alternative, sir? Let me decide
when I hear it," answered Randal, sullenly.
He began to lose respect for the man who owned
he could do so little for him, and who evidently
recommended him to shift for himself.</p>

<p>If one could have pierced into Egerton's gloomy
heart as he noted the young man's change of
tone, it may be a doubt whether one would have
seen there, pain or pleasure&mdash;pain, for merely
from the force of habit he had begun to like
Randal&mdash;or pleasure, at the thought that he
might have reason to withdraw that liking. So
lone and stoical had grown the man who had
made it his object to have no private life. Revealing,
however, neither pleasure or pain, but
with the composed calmness of a judge upon the
bench, Egerton replied:</p>

<p>"The alternative is, to continue in the course
you have begun, and still to rely on me."</p>

<p>"Sir, my dear Mr. Egerton," exclaimed Randal,
regaining all his usual tenderness of look
and voice, "rely on you! But that is all I ask!
Only&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Only, you would say, I am going out of
power, and you don't see the chance of my return?"</p>

<p>"I did not mean that."</p>

<p>"Permit me to suppose that you did; very
true; but the party I belong to is as sure of return
as the pendulum of that clock is sure to
obey the mechanism that moves it from left to
right. Our successors profess to come in upon
a popular question. All administrations who do
that are necessarily short-lived. Either they do
not go far enough to please present supporters,
or they go so far as to arm new enemies in the
rivals who outbid them with the people. 'Tis
the history of all revolutions, and of all reforms.
Our own administration in reality is destroyed
for having passed what was called a popular
measure a year ago, which lost us half our friends,
and refusing to propose another popular measure
this year, in the which we are outstripped by the
men who hallooed us on the last. Therefore,
whatever our successors do, we shall, by the law
of reaction, have another experiment of power
afforded to ourselves. It is but a question of
time; you can wait for it; whether I can is uncertain.
But if I die before that day arrives, I
have influence enough still left with those who
will come in, to obtain a promise of a better provision
for you than that which you have lost.
The promises of public men are proverbially uncertain.
But I shall intrust your cause to a man
who never failed a friend, and whose rank will
enable him to see that justice is done to you&mdash;I
speak of Lord L'Estrange."</p>

<p>"Oh, not him; he is unjust to me; he dislikes
me; he&mdash;"</p>

<p>"May dislike you (he has his whims), but he
loves me; and though for no other human being
but you would I ask Harley L'Estrange a favor<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_805" id="Page_805">[Pg 805]</a></span>
yet for <i>you</i> I will," said Egerton, betraying, for
the first time in that dialogue, a visible emotion&mdash;"for
you, a Leslie, a kinsman, however remote,
to the wife, from whom I received my fortune!
And despite all my cautions, it is possible that
in wasting that fortune I may have wronged you.
Enough: You have now before you the two options,
much as you had at first; but you have at
present more experience to aid you in your choice.
You are a man, and with more brains than most
men; think over it well, and decide for yourself.
Now to bed, and postpone thought till the morrow.
Poor Randal, you look pale!"</p>

<p>Audley, as he said the last words, put his hand
on Randal's shoulder, almost with a father's gentleness;
and then suddenly drawing himself up,
as the hard inflexible expression, stamped on that
face by years, returned, he moved away and resettled
to Public Life and the iron-box.</p>


<h3>CHAPTER XVIII.</h3>

<p>Early the next day Randal Leslie was in the
luxurious business-room of Baron Levy. How
unlike the cold Doric simplicity of the statesman's
library! Axminster carpets three inches
thick, <i>porti&egrave;res &agrave; la Fran&ccedil;aise</i> before the doors;
Parisian bronzes on the chimney-piece; and all
the receptacles that lined the room, and contained
title-deeds, and post-obits, and bills, and
promises to pay, and lawyer-like japan boxes,
with many a noble name written thereon in large
white capitals&mdash;"making ruin pompous"&mdash;all
these sepulchres of departed patrimonies veneered
in rosewood that gleamed with French polish,
and blazed with ormolu. There was a coquetry,
an air of <i>petit ma&icirc;tre</i>, so diffused over the whole
room, that you could not for the life of you recollect
that you were with a usurer. Plutus wore
the aspect of his enemy Cupid, and how realize
your idea of Harpagon in that Baron, with his
easy French "<i>Mon cher</i>," and his white warm
hands that pressed yours so genially, and his
dress so exquisite, even at the earliest morn?
No man ever yet saw that Baron in a dressing-gown
and slippers? As one fancies some feudal
baron of old (not half so terrible) everlastingly
clad in mail, so all one's notions of this grand
marauder of civilization were inseparably associated
with varnished boots, and a camelia in the
button-hole.</p>

<p>"And this is all that he does for you!" cried
the Baron, pressing together the points of his ten
taper fingers. "Had he but let you conclude
your career at Oxford, I have heard enough of
your scholarship to know that you would have
taken high honors&mdash;been secure of a fellowship&mdash;have
betaken yourself with content to a slow
and laborious profession&mdash;and prepared yourself
to die on the woolsack."</p>

<p>"He proposes to me now to return to Oxford,"
said Randal. "It is not too late!"</p>

<p>"Yes it is," said the Baron. "Neither individuals
nor nations ever go back of their own accord.
There must be an earthquake before a
river recedes to its source."</p>

<p>"You speak well," answered Randal, "and I
cannot gainsay you. But now!"</p>

<p>"Ah, the <i>now</i> is the grand question in life&mdash;the
<i>then</i> is obsolete, gone by&mdash;out of fashion; and
<i>now, mon cher</i>, you come to ask my advice."</p>

<p>"No, Baron; I come to ask your explanation."</p>

<p>"Of what?"</p>

<p>"I want to know why you spoke to me of Mr.
Egerton's ruin; why you spoke to me of the lands
to be sold by Mr. Thornhill; and why you spoke
to me of Count Peschiera. You touched on each
of those points within ten minutes&mdash;you omitted
to indicate what link can connect them."</p>

<p>"By Jove," said the Baron, rising, and with
more admiration in his face than you could have
conceived that face so smiling and so cynical
could exhibit&mdash;"by Jove, Randal Leslie, but your
shrewdness is wonderful. You really are the first
young man of your day; and I will 'help you,'
as I helped Audley Egerton. Perhaps you will
be more grateful."</p>

<p>Randal thought of Egerton's ruin. The parallel
implied by the Baron did not suggest to
him the rare enthusiasm of gratitude. However,
he merely said, "Pray, proceed&mdash;I listen to you
with interest."</p>

<p>"As for politics, then," said the Baron, "we
will discuss that topic later. I am waiting myself
to see how these new men get on. The first
consideration is for your private fortunes. You
should buy this ancient Leslie property&mdash;Rood
and Dulmansberry&mdash;only &pound;20,000 down; the rest
may remain on mortgage forever&mdash;or at least till
I find you a rich wife&mdash;as, in fact, I did for Egerton.
Thornhill wants the twenty thousand now&mdash;wants
them very much."</p>

<p>"And where," said Randal, with an iron smile,
"are the &pound;20,000 you ascribe to me to come
from?"</p>

<p>"Ten thousand shall come to you the day
Count Peschiera marries the daughter of his kinsman
with your help and aid&mdash;the remaining ten
thousand I will lend you. No scruple&mdash;I shall
hazard nothing&mdash;the estates will bear that additional
burden. What say you&mdash;shall it be so?"</p>

<p>"Ten thousand pounds from Count Peschiera!"
said Randal, breathing hard. "You can not be
serious? Such a sum&mdash;for what?&mdash;for a mere
piece of information? How otherwise can I aid
him? There must be a trick and deception intended
here."</p>

<p>"My dear fellow," answered Levy, "I will
give you a hint. There is such a thing in life as
being over suspicious. If you have a fault, it is
that. The information you allude to is, of course,
the first assistance you are to give. Perhaps
more may be needed&mdash;perhaps not. Of that you
will judge yourself, since the &pound;10,000 are contingent
on the marriage aforesaid."</p>

<p>"Over suspicious or not," answered Randal,
"the amount of the sum is too improbable, and
the security too bad, for me to listen to this proposition,
even if I could descend to&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Stop, <i>mon cher</i>. Business first&mdash;scruples afterward.
The security, too, bad&mdash;what security?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_806" id="Page_806">[Pg 806]</a></span>
"The word of Count di Peschiera."</p>

<p>"He has nothing to do with it&mdash;he need know
nothing about it. 'Tis my word you doubt. I
am your security."</p>

<p>Randal thought of that dry witticism in Gibbon,
"Abu Rafe says he will be witness for this
fact, but who will be witness for Abu Rafe?"
but he remained silent, only, fixing on Levy
those dark, observant eyes, with their contracted,
wary pupils.</p>

<p>"The fact is simply this," resumed Levy:
"Count di Peschiera has promised to pay his sister
a dowry of &pound;20,000, in case he has the money
to spare. He can only have it to spare by the
marriage we are discussing. On my part, as I
manage his affairs in England for him, I have
promised that, for the said sum of &pound;20,000, I will
guarantee the expenses in the way of that marriage,
and settle with Madame di Negra. Now,
though Peschiera is a very liberal, warm-hearted
fellow, I don't say that he would have named so
large a sum for his sister's dowry, if, in strict
truth, he did not owe it to her. It is the amount
of her own fortune, which, by some arrangements
with her late husband not exactly legal, he possessed
himself of. If Madame di Negra went to
law with him for it, she could get it back. I
have explained this to him; and, in short, you
now understand why the sum is thus assessed.
But I have bought up Madame di Negra's debts.
I have bought up young Hazeldean's (for we must
make a match between these two a part of our
arrangements). I shall present to Peschiera, and
to these excellent young persons, an account that
will absorb the whole &pound;20,000. That sum will
come into my hands. If I settle the claims
against them for half the money, which, making
myself the sole creditor, I have the right to do,
the moiety will remain. And if I choose to give
it to you, in return for the services which provide
Peschiera with a princely fortune&mdash;discharge the
debts of his sister&mdash;and secure her a husband in
my promising young client, Mr. Hazeldean, that
is my look-out&mdash;all parties are satisfied, and no
one need ever be the wiser. The sum is large,
no doubt; it answers to me to give it to you;
does it answer to you to receive it?"</p>

<p>Randal was greatly agitated; but, vile as he
was, and systematically as in thought he had
brought himself to regard others merely as they
could be made subservient to his own interest,
still, with all who have not hardened themselves
in actual crime, there is a wide distinction between
the thought and the act; and though, in
the exercise of ingenuity and cunning, he would
have had few scruples in that moral swindling
which is mildly called "outwitting another," yet
thus nakedly and openly to accept a bribe for a
deed of treachery toward the poor Italian who
had so generously trusted him&mdash;he recoiled. He
was nerving himself to refuse, when Levy, opening
his pocket-book, glanced over the memoranda
therein, and said, as to himself, "Rood Manor&mdash;Dulmansberry,
sold to the Thornhills by Sir Gilbert
Leslie, knight of the shire; estimated present
net rental &pound;2250, 7s. It is the greatest bargain
I ever knew. And with this estate in hand,
and your talents, Leslie, I don't see why you
should not rise higher than Audley Egerton. He
was poorer than you once!"</p>

<p>The old Leslie lands&mdash;a positive stake in the
country&mdash;the restoration of the fallen family;
and, on the other hand, either long drudgery at
the bar&mdash;a scanty allowance on Egerton's bounty&mdash;his
sister wasting her youth at slovenly, dismal
Rood&mdash;Oliver debased into a boor!&mdash;or a
mendicant's dependence on the contemptuous
pity of Harley L'Estrange&mdash;Harley who had
refused his hand to him&mdash;Harley who perhaps
would become the husband of Violante! Rage
seized him as these contrasting pictures rose before
his view. He walked to and fro in disorder,
striving to re-collect his thoughts, and reduce
himself from the passions of the human heart
into the mere mechanism of calculating intellect.
"I can not conceive," said he, abruptly, "why
you should tempt me thus&mdash;what interest is it to
you?"</p>

<p>Baron Levy smiled, and put up his pocket-book.
He saw from that moment that the victory
was gained.</p>

<p>"My dear boy," said he, with the most agreeable
<i>bonhomie</i>, "it is very natural that you should
think a man would have a personal interest in
whatever he does for another. I believe that
view of human nature is called utilitarian philosophy,
and is much in fashion at present. Let
me try and explain to you. In this affair I
shan't injure myself. True, you will say, if I
settle claims, which amount to &pound;20,000, for
&pound;10,000, I might put the surplus into my own
pocket instead of yours. Agreed. But I shall
not get the &pound;20,000, nor repay myself Madame
di Negra's debts (whatever I may do as to Hazeldean's),
unless the Count gets this heiress.
You can help in this. I want you; and I don't
think I could get you by a less offer than I make.
I shall soon pay myself back the &pound;10,000 if the
Count gets hold of the lady and her fortune.
Brief&mdash;I see my way here to my own interests.
Do you want more reasons&mdash;you shall have them.
I am now a very rich man. How have I become
so? Through attaching myself from the first to
persons of expectations, whether from fortune or
talent. I have made connections in society, and
society has enriched me. I have still a passion
for making money. <i>Que voulez vous?</i> It is my
profession, my hobby. It will be useful to me in
a thousand ways, to secure as a friend a young
man who will have influence with other young
men, heirs to something better than Rood Hall.
You may succeed in public life. A man in public
life may attain to the knowledge of state secrets
that are very profitable to one who dabbles
a little in the Funds. We can perhaps hereafter
do business together that may put yourself in a
way of clearing off all mortgages on these estates&mdash;on
the encumbered possession of which I shall
soon congratulate you. You see I am frank; 'tis
the only way of coming to the point with so clever<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_807" id="Page_807">[Pg 807]</a></span>
a fellow as you. And now, since the less we
rake up the mud in the pond from which we have
resolved to drink, the better, let us dismiss all
other thoughts but that of securing our end.
Will you tell Peschiera where the young lady is,
or shall I? Better do it yourself; reason enough
for it, that he has confided to you his hope, and
asked you to help him; why should not you?
Not a word to him about our little arrangement;
he need never know it. You need never be
troubled." Levy rang the bell: "Order my carriage
round."</p>

<p>Randal made no objection. He was deathlike
pale, but there was a sinister expression of firmness
on his thin bloodless lips.</p>

<p>"The next point," Levy resumed, "is to hasten
the match between Frank and the fair widow.
How does that stand!"</p>

<p>"She will not see me, nor receive him."</p>

<p>"Oh, learn why! And if you find on either
side there is a hitch, just let me know; I will
soon remove it."</p>

<p>"Has Hazeldean consented to the post-obit?"</p>

<p>"Not yet; I have not pressed it; I wait the
right moment, if necessary."</p>

<p>"It will be necessary."</p>

<p>"Ah, you wish it. It shall be so."</p>

<p>Randal Leslie again paced the room, and after
a silent self-commune, came up close to the Baron,
and said,</p>

<p>"Look you, sir, I am poor and ambitious; you
have tempted me at the right moment, and with
the right inducement. I succumb. But what
guarantee have I that this money will be paid&mdash;these
estates made mine upon the condition stipulated?"</p>

<p>"Before any thing is settled," replied the Baron,
"go and ask my character of any of our young
friends, Borrowell, Spendquick&mdash;whom you please;
you will hear me abused, of course; but they will
all say this of me, that when I pass my word I
keep it; if I say, '<i>Mon cher</i>, you shall have the
money,' a man has it; if I say, 'I renew your
bill for six months,' it is renewed. 'Tis my way
of doing business. In all cases my word is my
bond. In this case, where no writing can pass
between us, my only bond must be my word.
Go, then, make your mind clear as to your security,
and come here and dine at eight. We
will call on Peschiera afterward."</p>

<p>"Yes," said Randal, "I will at all events take
the day to consider. Meanwhile I say this, I do
not disguise from myself the nature of the proposed
transaction, but what I have once resolved
I go through with. My sole vindication to myself
is, that if I play here with a false die, it will
be for a stake so grand, as, once won, the magnitude
of the prize will cancel the ignominy of
the play. It is not this sum of money for which
I sell myself&mdash;it is for what that sum will aid
me to achieve. And in the marriage of young
Hazeldean with the Italian woman, I have another,
and it may be a large interest. I have
slept on it lately&mdash;I wake to it now. Insure that
marriage, obtain the post-obit from Hazeldean,
and whatever the issue of the more direct scheme
for which you seek my services, rely on my gratitude,
and believe that you will have put me in
the way to render gratitude of avail. At eight
I will be with you."</p>

<p>Randal left the room.</p>

<p>The Baron sat thoughtful. "It is true," said
he to himself, "this young man is the next of
kin to the Hazeldean estate, if Frank displease
his father sufficiently to lose his inheritance; that
must be the clever boy's design. Well, in the
long-run, I should make as much, or more, out
of him than out of the spendthrift Frank. Frank's
faults are those of youth. He will reform and
retrench. But <i>this</i> man! No, I shall have him
for life. And should he fail in this project, and
have but this encumbered property&mdash;a landed
proprietor mortgaged up to his ears&mdash;why, he is
my slave, and I can foreclose when I wish, or if
he prove useless;&mdash;no, I risk nothing. And if I
did&mdash;if I lost ten thousand pounds&mdash;what then?
I can afford it for revenge!&mdash;afford it for the luxury
of leaving Audley Egerton alone with penury
and ruin, deserted, in his hour of need, by the
pensioner of his bounty&mdash;as he will be by the last
friend of his youth&mdash;when it so pleases me&mdash;me
whom he has called 'scoundrel!' and whom he&mdash;"</p>

<p>Levy's soliloquy halted there, for the servant
entered to announce the carriage. And the Baron
hurried his hand over his features, as if to
sweep away all trace of the passions that distorted
their smiling effrontery. And so, as he
took up his cane and gloves, and glanced at the
glass, the face of the fashionable usurer was once
more as varnished as his boots.</p>


<h3>CHAPTER XIX.</h3>

<p>When a clever man resolves on a villainous
action, he hastens, by the exercise of his cleverness,
to get rid of the sense of his villainy. With
more than his usual alertness, Randal employed
the next hour or two in ascertaining how far
Baron Levy merited the character he boasted,
and how far his word might be his bond. He
repaired to young men whom he esteemed better
judges on these points than Spendquick and Borrowell&mdash;young
men who resembled the Merry
Monarch, inasmuch as</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"They never said a foolish thing,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And never did a wise one."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>There are many such young men about town&mdash;sharp
and able in all affairs except their own.
No one knows the world better, nor judges of
character mere truly, than your half-beggared
<i>rou&eacute;</i>. From all these, Baron Levy obtained much
the same testimonials: he was ridiculed as a
would-be dandy, but respected as a very responsible
man of business, and rather liked as a friendly
accommodating species of the Sir Epicure
Mammon, who very often did what were thought
handsome, liberal things; and, "in short," said
one of these experienced referees, "he is the best
fellow going&mdash;for a money-lender! You may
always rely on what he promises, and he is generally<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_808" id="Page_808">[Pg 808]</a></span>
very forbearing and indulgent to <i>us</i> of good
society! perhaps for the same reason that our
tailors are;&mdash;to send one of us to prison would
hurt his custom. His foible is to be thought a
gentleman. I believe, much as I suppose he
loves money, he would give up half his fortune
rather than do any thing for which we could cut
him. He allows a pension of three hundred a
year to Lord S&mdash;&mdash;. True; he was his man of
business for twenty years, and, before then, S&mdash;&mdash;
was rather a prudent fellow, and had fifteen thousand
a year. He has helped on, too, many a
clever young man;&mdash;the best boroughmonger you
ever knew. He likes having friends in Parliament.
In fact, of course he is a rogue; but if
one wants a rogue, one can't find a pleasanter.
I should like to see him on the French stage&mdash;a
prosperous <i>Macaire</i>; Le Ma&icirc;tre could hit him off
to the life."</p>

<p>From information in these more fashionable
quarters, gleaned with his usual tact, Randal
turned to a source less elevated, but to which he
attached more importance. Dick Avenel associated
with the Baron&mdash;Dick Avenel must be in
his clutches. Now Randal did justice to that
gentleman's practical shrewdness. Moreover,
Avenel was by profession a man of business.
He must know more of Levy than these men of
pleasure could; and, as he was a plain-spoken
person, and evidently honest, in the ordinary acceptation
of the word, Randal did not doubt that
out of Dick Avenel he should get the truth.</p>

<p>On arriving in Eton-square, and asking for Mr.
Avenel, Randal was at once ushered into the
drawing-room. The apartment was not in such
good solid mercantile taste as had characterized
Avenel's more humble bachelor's residence at
Screwstown. The taste now was the Honorable
Mrs. Avenel's; and, truth to say, no taste could
be worse. Furniture of all epochs heterogeneously
clumped together;&mdash;here a sofa <i>&agrave; la renaissance</i>
in <i>Gobelin</i>&mdash;there a rosewood Console from
Gillow&mdash;a tall mock-Elizabethan chair in black
oak, by the side of a modern Florentine table of
mosaic marbles. All kinds of colors in the room,
and all at war with each other. Very bad copies
of the best-known pictures in the world, in the
most gaudy frames, and impudently labeled by
the names of their murdered originals&mdash;"Raffaele,"
"Corregio," "Titian," "Sebastian del
Piombo." Nevertheless, there had been plenty
of money spent, and there was plenty to show
for it. Mrs. Avenel was seated on her sofa <i>&agrave; la
renaissance</i>, with one of her children at her feet,
who was employed in reading a new Annual in
crimson silk binding. Mrs. Avenel was in an
attitude as if sitting for her portrait.</p>

<p>Polite society is most capricious in its adoptions
or rejections. You see many a very vulgar person
firmly established in the <i>beau monde</i>; others,
with very good pretensions as to birth, fortune,
&amp;c., either rigorously excluded, or only permitted
a peep over the pales. The Honorable Mrs.
Avenel belonged to families unquestionably noble
both by her own descent and by her first
marriage; and if poverty had kept her down in
her earlier career, she now, at least, did not want
wealth to back her pretensions. Nevertheless,
all the dispensers of fashion concurred in refusing
their support to the Honorable Mrs. Avenel.
One might suppose it was solely on account of
her plebeian husband; but indeed it was not so.
Many a woman of high family can marry a low-born
man not so presentable as Avenel, and, by
the help of big money, get the fine world at her
feet. But Mrs. Avenel had not that art. She
was still a very handsome, showy woman; and
as for dress, no duchess could be more extravagant.
Yet these very circumstances had perhaps
gone against her ambition; for your quiet, little
plain woman, provoking no envy, slips into the
<i>coteries</i>, when a handsome, flaunting lady&mdash;whom,
once seen in your drawing-room, can be
no more overlooked than a scarlet poppy amidst
a violet bed&mdash;is pretty sure to be weeded out as
ruthlessly as a poppy would be in a similar position.</p>

<p>Mr. Avenel was sitting by the fire, rather
moodily, his hands in his pockets, and whistling
to himself. To say truth, that active mind of
his was very much bored in London, at least
during the forepart of the day. He hailed Randal's
entrance with a smile of relief, and rising
and posting himself before the fire&mdash;a coat tail
under each arm&mdash;he scarcely allowed Randal to
shake hands with Mrs. Avenel, and pat the child
on the head, murmuring, "Beautiful creature."
(Randal was ever civil to children&mdash;that sort of
wolf in sheep's clothing always is&mdash;don't be taken
in, O you foolish young mothers!) Dick, I say,
scarcely allowed his visitor these preliminary
courtesies, before he plunged far beyond depth
of both wife and child, into the political ocean
"Things now were coming right&mdash;a vile oligarchy
was to be destroyed. British respectability and
British talent were to have fair play." To have
heard him you would have thought the day fixed
for the millennium! "And what is more," said
Avenel, bringing down the fist of his right hand
upon the palm of his left, "if there is to be a
new parliament, we must have new men&mdash;not
worn out old brooms that never sweep clean, but
men who understand how to govern the country,
sir. I <span class="smcap">intend to come in myself</span>!"</p>

<p>"Yes," said Mrs. Avenel, hooking in a word
at last, "I am sure, Mr. Leslie, you will think I
did right. I persuaded Mr. Avenel that, with
his talents and property, he ought, for the sake
of his country, to make a sacrifice; and then
you know his opinions now are all the fashion,
Mr. Leslie: formerly they would have been called
shocking and&mdash;vulgar."</p>

<p>Thus saying she looked with fond pride at
Dick's comely face, which at that moment, however,
was all scowl and frown. I must do justice
to Mrs. Avenel; she was a weak silly woman
in some things, and a cunning one in others,
but she was a good wife as wives go. Scotch
women generally are.</p>

<h2>BLEAK HOUSE.<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a><br />

<small>BY CHARLES DICKENS.</small></h2>


<h3>CHAPTER V.&mdash;<span class="smcap">A Morning Adventure.</span></h3>

<p>Although the morning was raw, and although
the fog still seemed heavy&mdash;I say,
seemed, for the windows were so encrusted with
dirt, that they would have made Midsummer
sunshine dim&mdash;I was sufficiently forewarned of
the discomfort within doors at that early hour,
and sufficiently curious about London, to think
it a good idea on the part of Miss Jellyby when
she proposed that we should go out for a walk.</p>

<p>"Ma won't be down for ever so long," she
said, "and then it's a chance if breakfast's ready
for an hour afterward, they dawdle so. As to
Pa, he gets what he can, and goes to the office.
He never has what you would call a regular
breakfast. Priscilla leaves him out the loaf and
some milk, when there is any, over night. Sometimes
there isn't any milk, and sometimes the cat
drinks it. But I'm afraid you must be tired,
Miss Summerson; and perhaps you would rather
go to bed."</p>

<p>"I am not at all tired, my dear," said I, "and
would much prefer to go out."</p>

<p>"If you're sure you would," returned Miss Jellyby,
"I'll get my things on."</p>

<p>Ada said she would go, too, and was soon astir.
I made a proposal to Peepy, in default of being
able to do any thing better for him, that he should
let me wash him, and afterward lay him down on
my bed again. To this he submitted with the
best grace possible; staring at me during the
whole operation, as if he never had been, and
never could again be so astonished in his life&mdash;looking
very miserable also, certainly, but making
no complaint, and going snugly to sleep as
soon as it was over. At first I was in two minds
about taking such a liberty, but I soon reflected
that nobody in the house was likely to notice it.</p>

<p>What with the bustle of dispatching Peepy,
and the bustle of getting myself ready, and helping
Ada, I was soon quite in a glow. We found
Miss Jellyby trying to warm herself at the fire in
the writing-room, which Priscilla was then lighting
with a smutty parlor candlestick&mdash;throwing
the candle in to make it burn better. Every
thing was just as we had left it last night, and
was evidently intended to remain so. Below
stairs the dinner-cloth had not been taken away,
but had been left ready for breakfast. Crumbs,
dust, and waste paper were all over the house.
Some pewter-pots and a milk-can hung on the
area railings; the door stood open; and we met
the cook round the corner coming out of a public
house, wiping her mouth. She mentioned, as
she passed us, that she had just been to see what
o'clock it was.</p>

<p>But before we met the cook, we met Richard,
who was dancing up and down Thavies Inn to
warm his feet. He was agreeably surprised to
see us stirring so soon, and said he would gladly
share our walk. So he took care of Ada, and
Miss Jellyby and I went first. I may mention
that Miss Jellyby had relapsed into her sulky
manner, and that I really should not have thought
she liked me much, unless she had told me so.</p>

<p>"Where would you wish to go?" she asked.</p>

<p>"Any where, my dear," I replied.</p>

<p>"Any where's nowhere," said Miss Jellyby,
stopping perversely.</p>

<p>"Let us go somewhere at any rate," said I.</p>

<p>She then walked me on very fast.</p>

<p>"I don't care!" she said. "Now, you are my
witness, Miss Summerson, I say I don't care&mdash;but
if he was to come to our house, with his great,
shining, lumpy forehead, night after night till he
was as old as Methuselah, I wouldn't have any
thing to say to him. Such <span class="smcap">Asses</span> as he and Ma
make of themselves!"</p>

<p>"My dear!" I remonstrated, in allusion to the
epithet, and the vigorous emphasis Miss Jellyby
set upon it. "Your duty as a child&mdash;"</p>

<p>"O! don't talk of duty as a child, Miss Summerson;
where's Ma's duty as a parent? All
made over to the public and Africa, I suppose!
Then let the public and Africa show duty as a
child; it's much more their affair than mine.
You are shocked, I dare say! Very well, so am
I shocked, too; so we are both shocked, and there's
an end of it!"</p>

<p>She walked me on faster yet.</p>

<p>"But for all that, I say again, he may come,
and come, and come, and I won't have any thing
to say to him. I can't bear him. If there's any
stuff in the world that I hate and detest, it's the
stuff he and Ma talk. I wonder the very paving
stones opposite our house can have the patience
to stay there, and be a witness of such inconsistencies
and contradictions as all that sounding
nonsense, and Ma's management!"</p>

<p>I could not but understand her to refer to Mr.
Quale, the young gentleman who had appeared
after dinner yesterday. I was saved the disagreeable
necessity of pursuing the subject, by
Richard and Ada coming up at a round pace,
laughing, and asking us if we meant to run a
race? Thus interrupted, Miss Jellyby became
silent, and walked moodily on at my side; while
I admired the long successions and varieties of
streets, the quantity of people already going to
and fro, the number of vehicles passing and repassing,
the busy preparations in the setting forth
of shop windows and the sweeping out of shops,
and the extraordinary creatures in rags, secretly
groping among the swept-out rubbish for pins
and other refuse.</p>

<p>"So, cousin," said the cheerful voice of Richard
to Ada, behind me. "We are never to get out
of Chancery! We have come by another way to
our place of meeting yesterday, and&mdash;by the Great
Seal, here's the old lady again!"</p>

<p>Truly, there she was, immediately in front of
us, courtesying and smiling, and saying, with her
yesterday's air of patronage:</p>

<p>"The wards in Jarndyce! Ve-ry happy, I am
sure!"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_810" id="Page_810">[Pg 810]</a></span>
"You are out early, ma'am," said I, as she
courtesied to me.</p>

<p>"Ye-es! I usually walk here early. Before the
Court sits. It's retired. I collect my thoughts
here for the business of the day," said the old
lady, mincingly. "The business of the day requires
a great deal of thought. Chancery justice
is so ve-ry difficult to follow."</p>

<p>"Who's this, Miss Summerson?" whispered
Miss Jellyby, drawing my arm tighter through
her own.</p>

<p>The little old lady's hearing was remarkably
quick. She answered for herself directly.</p>

<p>"A suitor, my child. At your service. I have
the honor to attend court regularly. With my
documents. Have I the pleasure of addressing
another of the youthful parties in Jarndyce?"
said the old lady, recovering herself, with her head
on one side, from a very low courtesy.</p>

<p>Richard, anxious to atone for his thoughtlessness
of yesterday, good-naturedly explained that
Miss Jellyby was not connected with the suit.</p>

<p>"Ha!" said the old lady. "She does not expect
a judgment? She will still grow old. But
not so old. O dear, no! This is the garden of
Lincoln's Inn. I call it my garden. It is quite
a bower in the summer-time. Where the birds
sing melodiously. I pass the greater part of the
long vacation here. In contemplation. You find
the long vacation exceedingly long, don't you?"</p>

<p>We said yes, as she seemed to expect us to say
so.</p>

<p>"When the leaves are falling from the trees,
and there are no more flowers in bloom to make
up into nosegays for the Lord Chancellor's court,"
said the old lady, "the vacation is fulfilled; and
the Sixth Seal, mentioned in the Revelations, again
prevails. Pray come and see my lodging. It will
be a good omen for me. Youth, and hope, and
beauty are very seldom there. It is a long, long
time since I had a visit from either."</p>

<p>She had taken my hand, and, leading me and
Miss Jellyby away, beckoned Richard and Ada to
come too. I did not know how to excuse myself,
and looked to Richard for aid. As he was half
amused and half curious, and all in doubt how to
get rid of the old lady without offense, she continued
to lead us away, and he and Ada continued
to follow; our strange conductress informing
us all the time, with much smiling condescension,
that she lived close by.</p>

<p>It was quite true, as it soon appeared. She
lived so close by, that we had not time to have
done humoring her for a few moments, before she
was at home. Slipping us out at a little side
gate, the old lady stopped most unexpectedly in
a narrow back street, part of some courts and
lanes immediately outside the wall of the inn, and
said, "This is my lodging. Pray walk up!"</p>

<p>She had stopped at a shop, over which was
written, <span class="smcap">Krook, Rag and Bottle Warehouse</span>.
Also, in long thin letters, <span class="smcap">Krook, Dealer in
Marine Stores</span>. In one part of the window was
a picture of a red paper mill, at which a cart was
unloading a quantity of sacks of old rags. In another,
was the inscription, <span class="smcap">Bones Bought</span>. In
another, <span class="smcap">Kitchen-Stuff Bought</span>. In another,
<span class="smcap">Old Iron Bought</span>. In another, <span class="smcap">Waste Paper
Bought</span>. In another, <span class="smcap">Ladies' and Gentlemen's
Wardrobes Bought</span>. Every thing seemed to be
bought, and nothing to be sold there. In all parts
of the window, were quantities of dirty bottles:
blacking bottles, medicine bottles, ginger-beer and
soda-water bottles, pickle bottles, wine bottles,
ink bottles: I am reminded by mentioning the
latter, that the shop had, in several little particulars,
the air of being in a legal neighborhood,
and of being, as it were, a dirty hanger-on and
disowned relation of the law. There were a great
many ink bottles. There was a little tottering
bench of shabby old volumes, outside the door,
labeled, "Law Books, all at 9<i>d.</i>" Some of the
inscriptions I have enumerated were written in
law-hand, like the papers I had seen in Kenge and
Carboy's office, and the letters I had so long received
from the firm. Among them was one, in
the same writing, having nothing to do with the
business of the shop, but announcing that a respectable
man aged forty-five wanted engrossing
or copying to execute with neatness and dispatch:
Address to Nemo, care of Mr. Krook within.
There were several second-hand bags, blue and
red, hanging up. A little way within the shop
door, lay heaps of old crackled parchment scrolls,
and discolored and dog's-eared law-papers. I
could have fancied that all the rusty keys, of
which there must have been hundreds huddled
together as old iron, had once belonged to doors
of rooms or strong chests in lawyers' offices. The
litter of rags tumbled partly into and partly out of
a one-legged wooden scale, hanging without any
counterpoise from a beam, might have been counselors'
bands and gowns torn up. One had only
to fancy, as Richard whispered to Ada and me
while we all stood looking in, that yonder bones
in a corner, piled together and picked very clean,
were the bones of clients, to make the picture
complete.</p>

<p>As it was still foggy and dark, and as the shop
was blinded besides by the wall of Lincoln's Inn,
intercepting the light within a couple of yards,
we should not have seen so much but for a lighted
lantern that an old man in spectacles and a hairy
cap was carrying about in the shop. Turning
toward the door, he now caught sight of us. He
was short, cadaverous, and withered; with his
head sunk sideways between his shoulders, and
the breath issuing in visible smoke from his mouth,
as if he were on fire within. His throat, chin,
and eyebrows, were so frosted with white hairs,
and so gnarled with veins and puckered skin, that
he looked, from his breast upward, like some old
root in a fall of snow.</p>

<p>"Hi, hi!" said the old man, coming to the
door. "Have you any thing to sell?"</p>

<p>We naturally drew back and glanced at our
conductress, who had been trying to open the
house door with a key she had taken from her
pocket, and to whom Richard now said, that, as
we had had the pleasure of seeing where she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_811" id="Page_811">[Pg 811]</a></span>
lived, we would leave her, being pressed for
time. But she was not to be so easily left. She
became so fantastically and pressingly earnest
in her entreaties that we would walk up, and
see her apartment for an instant; and was so
bent, in her harmless way, on leading me in, as
part of the good omen she desired; that I (whatever
the others might do) saw nothing for it but
to comply. I suppose we were all more or less
curious;&mdash;at any rate, when the old man added
his persuasions to hers, and said, "Ay, ay!
Please her! It won't take a minute! Come in,
come in! Come in through the shop, if t'other
door's out of order!" we all went in, stimulated
by Richard's laughing encouragement, and relying
on his protection.</p>

<p>"My landlord, Krook!" said the little old lady,
condescending to him from her lofty station, as
she presented him to us. "He is called among
the neighbors the Lord Chancellor. His shop is
called the Court of Chancery. He is a very eccentric
person. He is very odd. Oh, I assure you
he is very odd!"</p>

<p>She shook her head a great many times, and
tapped her forehead with her finger, to express to
us that we must have the goodness to excuse
him, "For he is a little&mdash;you know!&mdash;M&mdash;!" said
the old lady, with great stateliness. The old
man overheard, and laughed.</p>

<p>"It's true enough," he said, going before us
with the lantern, "that they call me the Lord
Chancellor, and call my shop Chancery. And
why do you think they call me the Lord Chancellor,
and my shop Chancery?"</p>

<p>"I don't know, I am sure!" said Richard,
rather carelessly.</p>

<p>"You see," said the old man, stopping and
turning round, "they&mdash;Hi! Here's lovely hair!
I have got three sacks of ladies' hair below, but
none so beautiful and fine as this. What color,
and what texture!"</p>

<p>"That'll do, my good friend!" said Richard,
strongly disapproving of his having drawn one
of Ada's tresses through his yellow hand. "You
can admire as the rest of us do, without taking
that liberty."</p>

<p>The old man darted at him a sudden look,
which even called my attention from Ada, who,
startled and blushing, was so remarkably beautiful
that she seemed to fix the wondering attention
of the little old lady herself. But as Ada
interposed, and laughingly said she could only
feel proud of such genuine admiration, Mr. Krook
shrunk into his former self as suddenly as he had
leaped out of it.</p>

<p>"You see I have so many things here," he
resumed, holding up the lantern, "of so many
kinds, and all, as the neighbors think (but they
know nothing), wasting away and going to rack
and ruin, that that's why they have given me
and my place a christening. And I have so many
old parchmentses and papers in my stock. And
I have a liking for rust and must and cobwebs.
And all's fish that comes to my net. And I
can't abear to part with any thing I once lay
hold of (or so my neighbors think, but what do
<i>they</i> know?) or to alter any thing, or to have
any sweeping, nor scouring, nor cleaning, nor
repairing going on about me. That's the way
I've got the ill name of Chancery, <i>I</i> don't mind.
I go to see my noble and learned brother pretty
well every day, when he sits in the Inn. He
don't notice me, but I notice him. There's no
great odds betwixt us. We both grub on in a
muddle. Hi, Lady Jane!"</p>

<p>A large gray cat leaped from some neighboring
shelf on his shoulder, and startled us all.</p>

<p>"Hi! Show 'em how you can scratch. Hi!
Tear, my lady!" said her master.</p>

<p>The cat leaped down, and ripped at a bundle
of rags with her tigerish claws, with a sound
that it set my teeth on edge to hear.</p>

<p>"She'd do as much for any one I was to set
her on," said the old man. "I deal in cat-skins
among other general matters, and hers was offered
to me. It's a very fine skin, as you may
see, but I didn't have it stripped off! <i>That</i>
warn't like Chancery practice though, says you."</p>

<p>He had by this time led us across the shop,
and now opened a door in the back part of it,
leading to the house-entry. As he stood with
his hand upon the lock, the old lady graciously
observed to him before passing out:</p>

<p>"That will do, Krook. You mean well, but
are tiresome. My young friends are pressed for
time. I have none to spare myself, having to
attend court very soon. My young friends are
the wards in Jarndyce."</p>

<p>"Jarndyce!" said the old man, with a start.</p>

<p>"Jarndyce and Jarndyce. The great suit,
Krook," returned his lodger.</p>

<p>"Hi!" exclaimed the old man, in a tone of
thoughtful amazement, and with a wider stare
than before. "Think of it!"</p>

<p>He seemed so rapt all in a moment, and looked
so curiously at us, that Richard said:</p>

<p>"Why, you appear to trouble yourself a good
deal about the causes before your noble and
learned brother, the other Chancellor!"</p>

<p>"Yes," said the old man, abstractedly. "Sure!
<i>Your</i> name now will be&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Richard Carstone."</p>

<p>"Carstone," he repeated, slowly checking off
that name upon his forefinger; and each of the
others he went on to mention, upon a separate
finger. "Yes. There was the name of Barbary,
and the name of Clare, and the name of Dedlock,
too, I think."</p>

<p>"He knows as much of the cause as the real
salaried Chancellor!" said Richard, quite astonished,
to Ada and me.</p>

<p>"Ay!" said the old man, coming slowly out
of his abstraction. "Yes! Tom Jarndyce&mdash;you'll
excuse me, being related; but he was never
known about court by any other name, and was
as well known there, as&mdash;she is now;" nodding
slightly at his lodger; "Tom Jarndyce was often
in here. He got into a restless habit of strolling
about when the cause was on, or expected, talking
to the little shopkeepers, and telling 'em to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_812" id="Page_812">[Pg 812]</a></span>
keep out of Chancery, whatever they did. 'For,'
says he, 'it's being ground to bits in a slow mill;
it's being roasted at a slow fire; it's being stung
to death by single bees; it's being drowned by
drops; it's going mad by grains.' He was as
near making away with himself, just where the
young lady stands, as near could be."</p>

<p>We listened with horror.</p>

<p>"He come in at the door," said the old man,
slowly pointing an imaginary track along the
shop, "on the day he did it&mdash;the whole neighborhood
had said for months before, that he
would do it, of a certainty, sooner or later&mdash;he
come in at the door that day, and walked along
there, and sat himself on a bench that stood
there, and asked me (you'll judge I was a mortal
sight younger then) to fetch him a pint of wine.
'For,' says he, 'Krook, I am much depressed;
my cause is on again, and I think I'm nearer
Judgment than I ever was.' I hadn't a mind to
leave him alone; and I persuaded him to go to
the tavern over the way there, t'other side my
lane (I mean Chancery-lane); and I followed
and looked in at the window, and saw him, comfortable
as I thought, in the arm-chair by the
fire, and company with him. I hadn't hardly
got back here, when I heard a shot go echoing
and rattling right away into the inn. I ran out&mdash;neighbors
ran out&mdash;twenty of us cried at once,
'Tom Jarndyce!'"</p>

<p>The old man stopped, looked hard at us, looked
down into the lantern, blew the light out, and
shut the lantern up.</p>

<p>"We were right, I needn't tell the present
hearers. Hi! To be sure, how the neighborhood
poured into court that afternoon while the cause
was on! How my noble and learned brother,
and all the rest of 'em, grubbed and muddled
away as usual, and tried to look as if they hadn't
heard a word of the last fact in the case; or as
if they had&mdash;O dear me! nothing at all to do
with it, if they had heard of it by any chance!"</p>

<p>Ada's color had entirely left her, and Richard
was scarcely less pale. Nor could I wonder,
judging even from my emotions, and I was no
party in the suit, that to hearts so untried and
fresh, it was a shock to come into the inheritance
of a protracted misery, attended in the minds of
many people with such dreadful recollections. I
had another uneasiness, in the application of the
painful story to the poor half-witted creature who
had brought us there; but, to my surprise, she
seemed perfectly unconscious of that, and only
led the way up-stairs again; informing us, with
the toleration of a superior creature for the infirmities
of a common mortal, that her landlord
was "a little&mdash;M&mdash;, you know!"</p>

<p>She lived at the top of the house, in a pretty
large room, from which she had a glimpse of Lincoln's
Inn Hall. This seemed to have been her
principal inducement, originally, for taking up
her residence there. She could look at it, she
said, in the night: especially in the moonshine.
Her room was clean, but very, very bare. I noticed
the scantiest necessaries in the way of furniture;
a few old prints from books, of Chancellors
and barristers, wafered against the wall; and
some half-dozen reticules and work-bags, "containing
documents," as she informed us. There
were neither coals nor ashes in the grate, and I
saw no articles of clothing any where, nor any
kind of food. Upon a shelf in an open cupboard
were a plate or two, a cup or two, and so forth;
but all dry and empty. There was a more
affecting meaning in her pinched appearance, I
thought, as I looked round, than I had understood
before.</p>

<p>"Extremely honored, I am sure," said our
poor hostess, with the greatest suavity, "by this
visit from the wards in Jarndyce. And very
much indebted for the omen. It is a retired situation.
Considering, I am limited as to situation.
In consequence of the necessity of attending
on the Chancellor. I have lived here many
years. I pass my days in court; my evenings
and my nights here. I find the nights long, for
I sleep but little, and think much. That is, of
course, unavoidable; being in Chancery. I am
sorry I can not offer chocolate. I expect a judgment
shortly, and shall then place my establishment
on a superior footing. At present, I don't
mind confessing to the wards in Jarndyce (in
strict confidence), that I sometimes find it difficult
to keep up a genteel appearance. I have
felt the cold here. I have felt something sharper
than cold. It matters very little. Pray excuse
the introduction of such mean topics."</p>

<p>She partly drew aside the curtain of the long,
low garret-window, and called our attention to a
number of bird-cages hanging there: some, containing
several birds. There were larks, linnets,
and goldfinches&mdash;I should think at least twenty.</p>

<p>"I began to keep the little creatures," she
said, "with an object that the wards will readily
comprehend. With the intention of restoring
them to liberty. When my judgment should be
given. Ye-es! They die in prison, though.
Their lives, poor silly things, are so short in comparison
with Chancery proceedings, that, one by
one, the whole collection has died over and over
again. I doubt, do you know, whether one of
these, though they are all young, will live to be
free! Ve-ry mortifying, is it not?"</p>

<p>Although she sometimes asked a question, she
never seemed to expect a reply; but rambled on
as if she were in the habit of doing so, when no
one but herself was present.</p>

<p>"Indeed," she pursued, "I positively doubt
sometimes, I do assure you, whether while matters
are still unsettled, and the sixth or Great
Seal still prevails, <i>I</i> may not one day be found
lying stark and senseless here, as I have found so
many birds!"</p>

<p>Richard, answering what he saw in Ada's compassionate
eyes, took the opportunity of laying
some money, softly and unobserved, on the chimney-piece.
We all drew nearer to the cages,
feigning to examine the birds.</p>

<p>"I can't allow them to sing much," said the
little old lady, "for (you'll think this curious) I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_813" id="Page_813">[Pg 813]</a></span>
had my mind confused by the idea that they are
singing, while I am following the arguments in
court. And my mind requires to be so very clear,
you know! Another time, I'll tell you their
names. Not at present. On a day of such good
omen, they shall sing as much as they like. In
honor of youth," a smile and curtsey; "hope,"
a smile and curtsey; "and beauty," a smile and
curtsey. "There! We'll let in the full light."</p>

<p>The birds began to stir and chirp.</p>

<p>"I can not admit the air freely," said the little
old lady; the room was close, and would have
been the better for it; "because the cat you saw
down stairs&mdash;called Lady Jane&mdash;is greedy for
their lives. She crouches on the parapet outside,
for hours and hours. I have discovered,"
whispering mysteriously, "that her natural cruelty
is sharpened by a jealous fear of their regaining
their liberty. In consequence of the judgment
I expect being shortly given. She is sly,
and full of malice. I half believe, sometimes,
that she is no cat, but the wolf of the old saying.
It is so very difficult to keep her from the door."</p>

<p>Some neighboring bells reminding the poor soul
that it was half-past nine, did more for us in the
way of bringing our visit to an end, than we
could easily have done for ourselves. She hurriedly
took up her little bag of documents, which
she had laid upon the table on coming in, and
asked if we were also going into court? On our
answering no, and that we would on no account
detain her, she opened the door to attend us
down stairs.</p>

<p>"With such an omen, it is even more necessary
than usual that I should be there before the
Chancellor comes in," said she, "for he might
mention my case the first thing. I have a presentiment
that he <i>will</i> mention it the first thing
this morning."</p>

<p>She stopped to tell us, in a whisper, as we were
going down, that the whole house was filled with
strange lumber which her landlord had bought
piecemeal, and had no wish to sell&mdash;in consequence
of being a little&mdash;M&mdash;. This was on the
first floor. But she had made a previous stoppage
on the second floor, and had silently pointed
at a dark door there.</p>

<p>"The only other lodger," she now whispered,
in explanation; "a law-writer. The children in
the lanes here say he has sold himself to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_814" id="Page_814">[Pg 814]</a></span>
devil. I don't know what he can have done with
the money. Hush!"</p>

<p>She appeared to mistrust that the lodger might
hear her, even there; and repeating "Hush!"
went before us on tiptoe, as though even the
sound of her footsteps might reveal to him what
she had said.</p>

<p>Passing through the shop on our way out, as
we had passed through it on our way in, we
found the old man storing a quantity of packets
of waste paper, in a kind of well in the floor. He
seemed to be working hard, with the perspiration
standing on his forehead, and had a piece of chalk
by him; with which, as he put each separate
package or bundle down, he made a crooked mark
on the paneling of the wall.</p>

<p>Richard and Ada, and Miss Jellyby, and the
little old lady had gone by him, and I was going,
when he touched me on the arm to stay me, and
chalked the letter <i>J</i> upon the wall&mdash;in a very
curious manner, beginning with the end of the
letter and shaping it backward. It was a capital
letter, not a printed one, but just such a letter as
any clerk in Messrs. Kenge and Carboy's office
would have made.</p>

<p>"Can you read it?" he asked me, with a keen
glance.</p>

<p>"Surely," said I. "It's very plain."</p>

<p>"What is it?"</p>

<p>"J."</p>

<p>With another glance at me, and a glance at
the door, he rubbed it out, and turned an <i>a</i> in its
place (not a capital letter this time), and said,
"What's that?"</p>

<p>I told him. He then rubbed that out, and
turned the letter <i>r</i>, and asked me the same question.
He went on quickly, until he had formed,
in the same curious manner, beginning at the
ends and bottoms of the letters, the word <span class="smcap">Jarndyce</span>,
without once leaving two letters on the
wall together.</p>

<p>"What does that spell?" he asked me.</p>

<p>When I told him, he laughed. In the same
odd way, yet with the same rapidity, he then
produced singly, and rubbed out singly, the letters
forming the words <span class="smcap">Bleak House</span>. These,
in some astonishment, I also read; and he laughed
again.</p>

<p>"Hi!" said the old man, laying aside the
chalk, "I have a turn for copying from memory,
you see, miss, though I can neither read nor
write."</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 447px;">

<span class="caption">THE LORD CHANCELLOR COPIES FROM MEMORY.</span>
</div>

<p>He looked so disagreeable, and his cat looked
so wickedly at me, as if I were a blood-relation
of the birds up-stairs, that I was quite relieved
by Richard's appearing at the door and saying:</p>

<p>"Miss Summerson, I hope you are not bargaining
for the sale of your hair. Don't be
tempted. Three sacks below are quite enough
for Mr. Krook!"</p>

<p>I lost no time in wishing Mr. Krook good-morning,
and joining my friends outside, where we
parted with the little old lady, who gave us her
blessing with great ceremony, and renewed her
assurance of yesterday in reference to her intention
of settling estates on Ada and me. Before
we finally turned out of those lanes, we looked
back, and saw Mr. Krook standing at his shop-door,
in his spectacles, looking after us, with his
cat upon his shoulder, and her tail sticking up on
one side of his hairy cap, like a tall feather.</p>

<p>"Quite an adventure for a morning in London!"
said Richard, with a sigh. "Ah, cousin,
cousin, it's a weary word this Chancery."</p>

<p>"It is to me, and has been ever since I can
remember," returned Ada. "I am grieved that
I should be the enemy&mdash;as I suppose I am&mdash;of a
great number of relations and others; and that
they should be my enemies&mdash;as I suppose they
are; and that we should all be ruining one another,
without knowing how or why, and be in
constant doubt and discord all our lives. It seems
very strange, as there must be right somewhere,
that an honest judge in real earnest has not been
able to find out through all these years where it is."</p>

<p>"Ah, cousin!" said Richard. "Strange, indeed!
all this wasteful, wanton chess-playing is
very strange. To see that composed Court yesterday
jogging on so serenely, and to think of
the wretchedness of the pieces on the board, gave
me the headache and the heartache both together.
My head ached with wondering how it happened,
if men were neither fools nor rascals; and my
heart ached to think they could possibly be either.
But at all events, Ada&mdash;I may call you Ada?"</p>

<p>"Of course you may, cousin Richard."</p>

<p>"At all events, Ada, Chancery will work none
of its bad influence on <i>us</i>. We have happily been
brought together, thanks to our good kinsman,
and it can't divide us now!"</p>

<p>"Never, I hope, cousin Richard!" said Ada,
gently.</p>

<p>Miss Jellyby gave my arm a squeeze, and me
a very significant look. I smiled in return, and
we made the rest of the way back very pleasantly.</p>

<p>In half an hour after our arrival, Mrs. Jellyby
appeared; and in the course of an hour the various
things necessary for breakfast straggled one
by one into the dining-room. I do not doubt
that Mrs. Jellyby had gone to bed, and got up
in the usual manner, but she presented no appearance
of having changed her dress. She was
greatly occupied during breakfast; for the morning's
post brought a heavy correspondence relative
to Borrioboola-Gha, which would occasion her
(she said) to pass a busy day. The children
tumbled about, and notched memoranda of their
accidents in their legs, which were perfect little
calendars of distress; and Peepy was lost for an
hour and a half, and brought home from Newgate
market by a policeman. The equable manner
in which Mrs. Jellyby sustained both his absence,
and his restoration to the family circle,
surprised us all.</p>

<p>She was by that time perseveringly dictating
to Caddy, and Caddy was fast relapsing into the
inky condition in which we had found her. At
one o'clock an open carriage arrived for us, and
a cart for our luggage. Mrs. Jellyby charged us
with many remembrances to her good friend, Mr.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_815" id="Page_815">[Pg 815]</a></span>
Jarndyce; Caddy left her desk to see us depart,
kissed me in the passage, and stood, biting her
pen, and sobbing on the steps; Peepy, I am happy
to say, was asleep, and spared the pain of
separation (I was not without misgivings that he
had gone to Newgate market in search of me);
and all the other children got up behind the barouche
and fell off, and we saw them, with great
concern, scattered over the surface of Thavies
Inn, as we rolled out of its precincts.</p>


<h3>CHAPTER VI.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Quite at Home.</span></h3>

<p>The day had brightened very much, and still
brightened as we went westward. We went our
way through the sunshine and the fresh air, wondering
more and more at the extent of the streets,
the brilliancy of the shops, the great traffic, and
the crowds of people whom the pleasanter weather
seemed to have brought out like many-colored
flowers. By-and-by we began to leave the wonderful
city, and to proceed through suburbs which,
of themselves, would have made a pretty large
town, in my eyes; and at last we got into a real
country road again, with wind-mills, rick-yards,
milestones, farmers' wagons, scents of old hay,
swinging signs, and horse-troughs: trees, fields,
and hedge-rows. It was delightful to see the
green landscape before us, and the immense metropolis
behind; and when a wagon with a train
of beautiful horses, furnished with red trappings
and clear-sounding bells, came by us with its
music, I believe we could all three have sung
to the bells, so cheerful were the influences
around.</p>

<p>"The whole road has been reminding me of
my namesake, Whittington," said Richard, "and
that wagon is the finishing touch. Halloa! what's
the matter?"</p>

<p>We had stopped, and the wagon had stopped,
too. Its music changed as the horses came to a
stand, and subsided to a gentle tinkling, except
when a horse tossed his head, or shook himself,
and sprinkled off a little shower of bell-ringing.</p>

<p>"Our postillion is looking after the wagoner,"
said Richard; "and the wagoner is coming back
after us. Good-day, friend!" The wagoner was
at our coach-door. "Why, here's an extraordinary
thing!" added Richard, looking closely at the
man. "He has got your name, Ada, in his hat!"</p>

<p>He had all our names in his hat. Tucked
within the band, were three small notes; one,
addressed to Ada; one, to Richard, one, to me.
These the wagoner delivered to each of us respectively,
reading the name aloud first. In answer
to Richard's inquiry from whom they came,
he briefly answered, "Master, sir, if you please;"
and, putting on his hat again (which was like a
soft bowl), cracked his whip, re-awakened his
music, and went melodiously away.</p>

<p>"Is that Mr. Jarndyce's wagon?" said Richard,
calling to our post-boy.</p>

<p>"Yes, sir," he replied. "Going to London."</p>

<p>We opened the notes. Each was a counterpart
of the other, and contained these words, in
a solid, plain hand:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"I look forward, my dear, to our meeting easily,
and without constraint on either side. I therefore
have to propose that we meet as old friends,
and take the past for granted. It will be a relief
to you possibly, and to me certainly, and so my
love to you.</p>

<p class="right"><span class="smcap">John Jarndyce.</span>"</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I had, perhaps, less reason to be surprised than
either of my companions, having never yet enjoyed
an opportunity of thanking one who had
been my benefactor and sole earthly dependence
through so many years. I had not considered
how I could thank him, my gratitude lying too
deep in my heart for that; but I now began to
consider how I could meet him without thanking
him, and felt it would be very difficult indeed.</p>

<p>The notes revived, in Richard and Ada, a general
impression that they both had, without quite
knowing how they came by it, that their cousin,
Jarndyce, could never bear acknowledgments for
any kindness he performed, and that, sooner than
receive any, he would resort to the most singular
expedients and evasions, or would even run away.
Ada dimly remembered to have heard her mother
tell, when she was a very little child, that he had
once done her an act of uncommon generosity,
and that on her going to his house to thank him,
he happened to see her through a window coming
to the door, and immediately escaped by the back
gate, and was not heard of for three months.
This discourse led to a great deal more on the
same theme, and indeed it lasted us all day, and
we talked of scarcely any thing else. If we did,
by any chance, diverge into another subject, we
soon returned to this; and wondered what the
house would be like, and when we should get
there, and whether we should see Mr. Jarndyce as
soon as we arrived, or after a delay, and what he
would say to us, and what we should say to him.
All of which we wondered about, over and over
again.</p>

<p>The roads were very heavy for the horses, but
the pathway was generally good; so we alighted
and walked up all the hills, and liked it so well
that we prolonged our walk on the level ground
when we got to the top. At Barnet there were
other horses waiting for us; but as they had only
just been fed, we had to wait for them, too, and
got a long fresh walk, over a common and an old
battle-field, before the carriage came up. These
delays so protracted the journey, that the short
day was spent, and the long night had closed in,
before we came to Saint Albans; near to which
town Bleak House was, we knew.</p>

<p>By that time we were so anxious and nervous,
that even Richard confessed, as we rattled over
the stones of the old street, to feeling an irrational
desire to drive back again. As to Ada and me,
whom he had wrapped up with great care, the
night being sharp and frosty, we trembled from
head to foot. When we turned out of the town,
round a corner, and Richard told us that the
post-boy, who had for a long time sympathized
with our heightened expectation, was looking
back and nodding, we both stood up in the carriage<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_816" id="Page_816">[Pg 816]</a></span>
(Richard holding Ada, lest she should be
jolted down), and gazed round upon the open
country and the starlight night, for our destination.
There was a light sparkling on the top of
a hill before us, and the driver, pointing to it
with his whip and crying, "That's Bleak House!"
put his horses into a canter, and took us forward
at such a rate, up-hill though it was, that the
wheels sent the road-drift flying about our heads
like spray from a water-mill. Presently we lost
the light, presently saw it, presently lost it, presently
saw it, and turned into an avenue of trees,
and cantered up toward where it was beaming
brightly. It was in a window of what seemed
to be an old-fashioned house, with three peaks in
the roof in front, and a circular sweep leading to
the porch. A bell was rung as we drew up, and
amidst the sound of its deep voice in the still air,
and the distant barking of some dogs, and a gush
of light from the opened door, and the smoking and
steaming of the heated horses, and the quickened
beating of our own hearts, we alighted in no inconsiderable
confusion.</p>

<p>"Ada, my love, Esther, my dear, you are welcome.
I rejoice to see you! Rick, if I had a
hand to spare at present, I would give it you!"</p>

<p>The gentleman who said these words in a clear,
bright, hospitable voice, had one of his arms
round Ada's waist, and the other round mine,
and kissed us both in a fatherly way, and bore
us across the hall into a ruddy little room, all in
a glow with a blazing fire. Here he kissed us
again, and, opening his arms, made us sit down
side-by-side, on a sofa ready drawn out near the
hearth. I felt that if we had been at all demonstrative,
he would have run away in a moment.</p>

<p>"Now, Rick," said he, "I have a hand at liberty.
A word in earnest is as good as a speech.
I am heartily glad to see you. You are at home.
Warm yourself!"</p>

<p>Richard shook him by both hands with an intuitive
mixture of respect and frankness, and only
saying (though with an earnestness that rather
alarmed me, I was so afraid of Mr. Jarndyce's
suddenly disappearing), "You are very kind, sir!
We are very much obliged to you!" laid aside
his hat and coat, and came up to the fire.</p>

<p>"And how did you like the ride? And how
did you like Mrs. Jellyby, my dear?" said Mr.
Jarndyce to Ada.</p>

<p>While Ada was speaking to him in reply, I
glanced (I need not say with how much interest)
at his face. It was a handsome, lively, quick
face, full of change and motion; and his hair was
a silvered iron-gray. I took him to be nearer
sixty than fifty, but he was upright, hearty, and
robust. From the moment of his first speaking
to us, his voice had connected itself with an
association in my mind that I could not define;
but now, all at once, a something sudden in his,
manner, and a pleasant expression in his eyes,
recalled the gentleman in the stage-coach, six
years ago, on the memorable day of my journey
to Reading. I was certain it was he. I never
was so frightened in my life as when I made the
discovery, for he caught my glance, and appearing
to read my thoughts, gave such a look at the
door that I thought we had lost him.</p>

<p>However, I am happy to say that he remained
where he was, and asked me what <i>I</i> thought of
Mrs. Jellyby.</p>

<p>"She exerts herself very much for Africa, sir,"
I said.</p>

<p>"Nobly!" returned Mr. Jarndyce. "But you
answer like Ada," whom I had not heard. "You
all think something else, I see."</p>

<p>"We rather thought," said I, glancing at
Richard and Ada, who entreated me with their
eyes to speak, "that perhaps she was a little unmindful
of her home."</p>

<p>"Floored!" cried Mr. Jarndyce.</p>

<p>I was rather alarmed again.</p>

<p>"Well! I want to know your real thoughts,
my dear. I may have sent you there on purpose."</p>

<p>"We thought that, perhaps," said I, hesitating,
"it is right to begin with the obligations of home,
sir; and that, perhaps, while those are overlooked
and neglected, no other duties can possibly be
substituted for them?"</p>

<p>"The little Jellybys," said Richard, coming to
my relief, "are really&mdash;I can't help expressing
myself strongly, sir&mdash;in a devil of a state."</p>

<p>"She means well," said Mr. Jarndyce, hastily.
"The wind's in the east."</p>

<p>"It was in the north, sir, as we came down,"
observed Richard.</p>

<p>"My dear Rick," said Mr. Jarndyce, poking
the fire; "I'll take an oath it's either in the east,
or going to be. I am always conscious of an
uncomfortable sensation now and then when the
wind is blowing in the east."</p>

<p>"Rheumatism, sir?" said Richard.</p>

<p>"I dare say it is, Rick. I believe it is. And
so the little Jell&mdash;I had my doubts about 'em&mdash;are
in a&mdash;oh, Lord, yes, it's easterly!" said Mr.
Jarndyce.</p>

<p>He had taken two or three undecided turns up
and down while uttering these broken sentences,
retaining the poker in one hand and rubbing his
hair with the other, with a good-natured vexation,
at once so whimsical and so lovable, that I am
sure we were more delighted with him than we
could possibly have expressed in any words. He
gave an arm to Ada and an arm to me, and
bidding Richard bring a candle, was leading the
way out, when he suddenly turned us all back
again.</p>

<p>"Those little Jellybys. Couldn't you&mdash;didn't
you&mdash;now, if it had rained sugar-plums, or three-cornered
raspberry tarts, or any thing of that
sort!" said Mr. Jarndyce.</p>

<p>"O cousin&mdash;!" Ada hastily began.</p>

<p>"Good, my pretty pet. I like cousin. Cousin
John, perhaps, is better."</p>

<p>"Then, cousin John!&mdash;" Ada laughingly began
again.</p>

<p>"Ha, ha! Very good indeed!" said Mr. Jarndyce,
with great enjoyment. "Sounds uncommonly
natural. Yes, my dear?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_817" id="Page_817">[Pg 817]</a></span>
"It did better than that. It rained Esther."</p>

<p>"Ay?" said Mr. Jarndyce. "What did Esther
do?"</p>

<p>"Why, cousin John," said Ada, clasping her
hands upon his arm, and shaking her head at
me across him&mdash;for I wanted her to be quiet:
"Esther was their friend directly. Esther nursed
them, coaxed them to sleep, washed and dressed
them, told them stories, kept them quiet, bought
them keepsakes."&mdash;My dear girl! I had only
gone out with Peepy, after he was found, and
given him a little, tiny horse!&mdash;"and, cousin
John, she softened poor Caroline, the eldest one,
so much, and was so thoughtful for me and so
amiable!&mdash;No, no, I won't be contradicted, Esther
dear! You know, you know, it's true!"</p>

<p>The warm-hearted darling leaned across her
cousin John, and kissed me; and then, looking
up in his face, boldly said, "At all events, cousin
John, I <i>will</i> thank you for the companion you
have given me." I felt as if she challenged him
to run away. But he didn't.</p>

<p>"Where did you say the wind was, Rick?"
asked Mr. Jarndyce.</p>

<p>"In the north, as we came down, sir."</p>

<p>"You are right. There's no east in it. A
mistake of mine. Come girls, come and see your
home!"</p>

<p>It was one of those delightfully irregular houses
where you go up and down steps, out of one room
into another, and where you come upon more
rooms when you think you have seen all there
are, and where there is a bountiful provision of
little halls and passages, and where you find still
older cottage-rooms in unexpected places, with lattice
windows and green growth pressing through
them. Mine, which we entered first, was of this
kind, with an up-and-down roof, that had more
corners in it than I ever counted afterward, and
a chimney (there was a wood-fire on the hearth)
paved all round with pure white tiles, in every
one of which a bright miniature of the fire was
blazing. Out of this room, you went down two
steps, into a charming little sitting-room, looking
down upon a flower-garden, which room was
henceforth to belong to Ada and me. Out of
this you went up three steps, into Ada's bed-room,
which had a fine broad window, commanding
a beautiful view (we saw a great expanse of
darkness lying underneath the stars), to which
there was a hollow window-seat, in which, with
a spring-lock, three dear Adas might have been
lost at once. Out of this room, you passed into
a little gallery, with which the other best rooms
(only two) communicated, and so, by a little
staircase of shallow steps, with a great number of
corner stairs in it, considering its length, down
into the hall. But if, instead of going out at
Ada's door, you came back into my room, and
went out at the door by which you had entered
it, and turned up a few crooked steps that
branched off in an unexpected manner from the
stairs, you lost yourself in passages, with mangles
in them, and three-cornered tables, and a
Native-Hindoo chair, which was also a sofa, a
box, and a bedstead, and looked, in every form,
something between a bamboo skeleton and a
great bird-cage, and had been brought from
India nobody knew by whom, or when. From
these, you came on Richard's room, which was
part library, part sitting-room, part bed-room,
and seemed indeed a comfortable compound of
many rooms. Out of that, you went straight,
with a little interval of passage, to the plain
room where Mr. Jarndyce slept, all the year
round, with his window open, his bedstead, without
any furniture, standing in the middle of the
floor for more air, and his cold-bath gaping for
him in a smaller room adjoining. Out of that,
you came into another passage, where there were
back-stairs, and where you could hear the horses
being rubbed down, outside the stable, and being
told to Hold up, and Get over, as they slipped
about very much on the uneven stones. Or you
might, if you came out at another door (every
room had at least two doors), go straight down
to the hall again by half-a-dozen steps and a
low archway, wondering how you got back there,
or had ever got out of it.</p>

<p>The furniture, old-fashioned rather than old,
like the house, was as pleasantly irregular. Ada's
sleeping-room was all flowers&mdash;in chintz and paper;
in velvet, in needle-work, in the brocade of
two stiff courtly chairs, which stood, each attended
by a little page of a stool for greater state, on
either side of the fire-place. Our sitting-room was
green; and had, framed and glazed, upon the
walls, numbers of surprising and surprised birds,
staring out of pictures at a real trout in a case,
as brown and shining as if it had been served with
gravy; at the death of Captain Cook; and at the
whole process of preparing tea in China, as depicted
by Chinese artists. In my room there were
oval engravings of the months&mdash;ladies hay-making,
in short waists, and large hats tied under the
chin, for June&mdash;smooth-legged noblemen, pointing,
with cocked-hats, to village steeples, for October.
Half-length portraits, in crayons, abounded
all through the house; but were so dispersed
that I found the brother of a youthful officer of
mine in the china-closet, and the gray old age
of my pretty young bride, with a flower in her
boddice, in the breakfast-room. As substitutes,
I had four angels, of Queen Anne's reign, taking
a complacent gentleman to heaven, in festoons,
with some difficulty; and a composition in needle-work,
representing fruit, a kettle, and an alphabet.
All the movables, from the wardrobes to
the chairs and tables, hangings, glasses, even to
the pincushions and scent-bottles on the dressing-tables,
displayed the same quaint variety.
They agreed in nothing but their perfect neatness,
their display of the whitest linen, and their
storing-up, wheresoever the existence of a drawer,
small or large, rendered it possible, of quantities
of rose-leaves and sweet lavender. Such,
with its illuminated windows, softened here and
there by shadows of curtains, shining out upon
the starlight night; with its light, and warmth,
and comfort; with its hospitable jingle, at a distance,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_818" id="Page_818">[Pg 818]</a></span>
of preparations for dinner; with the face
of its generous master brightening every thing we
saw; and just wind enough without to sound a
low accompaniment to every thing we heard;
were our first impressions of Bleak House.</p>

<p>"I am glad you like it," said Mr. Jarndyce,
when he had brought us round again to Ada's
sitting-room. "It makes no pretensions; but it
is a comfortable little place, I hope, and will be
more so with such bright young looks in it. You
have barely half an hour before dinner. There's
no one here but the finest creature upon earth&mdash;a
child."</p>

<p>"More children, Esther!" said Ada.</p>

<p>"I don't mean literally a child," pursued Mr.
Jarndyce; "not a child in years. He is grown
up&mdash;he is at least as old as I am&mdash;but in simplicity,
and freshness, and enthusiasm, and a fine
guileless inaptitude for all worldly affairs, he is
a perfect child."</p>

<p>We felt that he must be very interesting.</p>

<p>"He knows Mrs. Jellyby," said Mr. Jarndyce.
"He is a musical man; an Amateur, but might
have been a Professional. He is an Artist, too;
an Amateur, but might have been a Professional.
He is a man of attainments and of captivating
manners. He has been unfortunate in his affairs,
and unfortunate in his pursuits, and unfortunate
in his family; but he don't care&mdash;he's a child!"</p>

<p>"Did you imply that he has children of his
own, sir?" inquired Richard.</p>

<p>"Yes, Rick! Half-a-dozen. More! Nearer a
dozen, I should think. But he has never looked
after them. How could he? He wanted somebody
to look after <i>him</i>. He is a child, you know!"
said Mr. Jarndyce.</p>

<p>"And have the children looked after themselves
at all, sir?" inquired Richard.</p>

<p>"Why, just as you may suppose," said Mr.
Jarndyce: his countenance suddenly falling. "It
is said that the children of the very poor are not
brought up, but dragged up. Harold Skimpole's
children have tumbled up somehow or other.&mdash;The
wind's getting round again, I am afraid. I
feel it rather!"</p>

<p>Richard observed that the situation was exposed
on a sharp night.</p>

<p>"It is exposed," said Mr. Jarndyce. "No doubt
that's the cause. Bleak House has an exposed
sound. But you are coming my way. Come
along!"</p>

<p>Our luggage having arrived, and being all at
hand, I was dressed in a few minutes, and engaged
in putting my worldly goods away, when
a maid (not the one in attendance upon Ada, but
another whom I had not seen) brought a basket
into my room, with two bunches of keys in it, all
labeled.</p>

<p>"For you, miss, if you please," said she.</p>

<p>"For me?" said I.</p>

<p>"The housekeeping keys, miss."</p>

<p>I showed my surprise; for she added, with
some little surprise on her own part: "I was told
to bring them as soon as you was alone, miss.
Miss Summerson, if I don't deceive myself?"</p>

<p>"Yes," said I. "That is my name."</p>

<p>"The large bunch is the housekeeping, and the
little bunch is the cellars, miss. Any time you
was pleased to appoint to-morrow morning, I was
to show you the presses and things they belong
to."</p>

<p>I said I would be ready at half-past six; and,
after she was gone, stood looking at the basket,
quite lost in the magnitude of my trust. Ada
found me thus; and had such a delightful confidence
in me when I showed her the keys, and
told her about them, that it would have been insensibility
and ingratitude not to feel encouraged.
I knew, to be sure, that it was the dear girl's
kindness; but I liked to be so pleasantly cheated.</p>

<p>When we went down stairs, we were presented
to Mr. Skimpole, who was standing before the
fire, telling Richard how fond he used to be, in
his school-time, of football. He was a little
bright creature, with a rather large head; but a
delicate face, and a sweet voice, and there was
a perfect charm in him. All he said was so free
from effort and spontaneous, and was said with
such a captivating gayety, that it was fascinating
to hear him talk. Being of a more slender figure
than Mr. Jarndyce, and having a richer complexion,
with browner hair, he looked younger. Indeed,
he had more the appearance, in all respects,
of a damaged young man, than a well-preserved
elderly one. There was an easy negligence in
his manner, and even in his dress (his hair carelessly
disposed, and his neck-kerchief loose and
flowing, as I have seen artists paint their own
portraits), which I could not separate from the
idea of a romantic youth who had undergone
some unique process of depreciation. It struck
me as being not at all like the manner or appearance
of a man who had advanced in life, by the
usual road of years, cares, and experiences.</p>

<p>I gathered from the conversation, that Mr.
Skimpole had been educated for the medical profession,
and had once lived, in his professional
capacity, in the household of a German prince.
He told us, however, that as he had always been
a mere child in point of weights and measures,
and had never known any thing about them (except
that they disgusted him), he had never been
able to prescribe with the requisite accuracy of
detail. In fact, he said, he had no head for detail.
And he told us, with great humor, that
when he was wanted to bleed the prince, or
physic any of his people, he was generally found
lying on his back in bed, reading the newspapers,
or making fancy-sketches in pencil, and couldn't
come. The prince, at last, objecting to this, "in
which," said Mr. Skimpole, in the frankest manner,
"he was perfectly right," the engagement
terminated; and Mr. Skimpole having (as he
added with delightful gayety) "nothing to live
upon but love, fell in love, and married, and surrounded
himself with rosy cheeks." His good
friend Jarndyce and some other of his good friends
then helped him, in quicker or slower succession,
to several openings in life; but to no purpose,
for he must confess to two of the oddest infirmities<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_819" id="Page_819">[Pg 819]</a></span>
in the world: one was, that he had no idea
of time; the other, that he had no idea of money.
In consequence of which, he never kept an appointment,
never could transact any business,
and never knew the value of any thing! Well!
So he had got on in life, and here he was! He
was very fond of reading the papers, very fond
of making fancy-sketches with a pencil, very fond
of nature, very fond of art. All he asked of society
was, to let him live. <i>That</i> wasn't much.
His wants were few. Give him the papers, conversation,
music, mutton, coffee, landscape, fruit
in season, a few sheets of Bristol-board, and a
little claret, and he asked no more. He was a
mere child in the world, but he didn't cry for the
moon. He said to the world, "Go your several
ways in peace! Wear red coats, blue coats,
lawn-sleeves, put pens behind your ears, wear
aprons; go after glory, holiness, commerce, trade,
any object you prefer; only&mdash;let Harold Skimpole
live!"</p>

<p>All this, and a great deal more, he told us, not
only with the utmost brilliancy and enjoyment,
but with a certain vivacious candor&mdash;speaking
of himself as if he were not at all his own affair,
as if Skimpole were a third person, as if he knew
that Skimpole had his singularities, but still had
his claims too, which were the general business
of the community, and must not be slighted. He
was quite enchanting. If I felt at all confused
at that early time, in endeavoring to reconcile
any thing he said with any thing I had thought
about the duties and accountabilities of life (which
I am far from sure of), I was confused by not exactly
understanding why he was free of them.
That he was free of them, I scarcely doubted; he
was so very clear about it himself.</p>

<p>"I covet nothing," said Mr. Skimpole, in the
same light way. "Possession is nothing to me.
Here is my friend Jarndyce's excellent house. I
feel obliged to him for possessing it. I can sketch
it, and alter it. I can set it to music. When I
am here, I have sufficient possession of it, and
have neither trouble, cost, nor responsibility. My
steward's name, in short, is Jarndyce, and he
can't cheat me. We have been mentioning Mrs.
Jellyby. There is a bright-eyed woman, of a
strong will and immense power of business-detail,
who throws herself into objects with surprising
ardor! I don't regret that <i>I</i> have not a strong
will and an immense power of business-detail, to
throw myself into objects with surprising ardor.
I can admire her without envy. I can sympathize
with the objects. I can dream of them. I
can lie down on the grass in fine weather&mdash;and
float along an African river, embracing all the
natives I meet, as sensible of the deep silence,
and sketching the dense overhanging tropical
growth as accurately, as if I were there. I don't
know that it's of any direct use my doing so, but
it's all I can do, and I do it thoroughly. Then,
for heaven's sake, having Harold Skimpole, a
confiding child, petitioning you, the world, an
agglomeration of practical people of business
habits, to let him live and admire the human
family, do it somehow or other, like good souls,
and suffer him to ride his rocking-horse!"</p>

<p>It was plain enough that Mr. Jarndyce had
not been neglectful of the adjuration. Mr. Skimpole's
general position there would have rendered
it so, without the addition of what he presently
said.</p>

<p>"It's only you, the generous creatures, whom
I envy," said Mr. Skimpole, addressing us, his
new friends, in an impersonal manner. "I envy
you your power of doing what you do. It is
what I should revel in, myself. I don't feel any
vulgar gratitude to you. I almost feel as if <i>you</i>
ought to be grateful to <i>me</i>, for giving you the opportunity
of enjoying the luxury of generosity. I
know you like it. For any thing I can tell, I may
have come into the world expressly for the purpose
of increasing your stock of happiness. I
may have been born to be a benefactor to you,
by sometimes giving you an opportunity of assisting
me in my little perplexities. Why should
I regret my incapacity for details and worldly affairs,
when it leads to such pleasant consequences?
I don't regret it therefore."</p>

<p>Of all his playful speeches (playful, yet always
fully meaning what they expressed) none seemed
to be more to the taste of Mr. Jarndyce than this.
I had often new temptations, afterward, to wonder
whether it was really singular, or only singular to
me, that he, who was probably the most grateful
of mankind upon the least occasion, should so
desire to escape the gratitude of others.</p>

<p>We were all enchanted. I felt it a merited
tribute to the engaging qualities of Ada and
Richard, that Mr. Skimpole, seeing them for the
first time, should be so unreserved, and should
lay himself out to be so exquisitely agreeable.
They (and especially Richard) were naturally
pleased for similar reasons, and considered it no
common privilege to be so freely confided in by
such an attractive man. The more we listened,
the more gayly Mr. Skimpole talked. And what
with his fine hilarious manner, and his engaging
candor, and his genial way of lightly tossing his
own weaknesses about, as if he had said, "I am
a child, you know! You are designing people
compared with me;" (he really made me consider
myself in that light); "but I am gay and innocent;
forget your worldly arts and play with me!"&mdash;the
effect was absolutely dazzling.</p>

<p>He was so full of feeling too, and had such a
delicate sentiment for what was beautiful or tender,
that he could have won a heart by that alone.
In the evening when I was preparing to make
tea, and Ada was touching the piano in the adjoining
room, and softly humming a tune to her
cousin Richard, which they had happened to
mention, he came and sat down on the sofa near
me, and so spoke of Ada that I almost loved
him.</p>

<p>"She is like the morning," he said. "With
that golden hair, those blue eyes, and that fresh
bloom on her cheek, she is like the summer
morning. The birds here will mistake her for it.
We will not call such a lovely young creature as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_820" id="Page_820">[Pg 820]</a></span>
that, who is a joy to all mankind, an orphan.
She is the child of the universe."</p>

<p>Mr. Jarndyce, I found, was standing near us,
with his hands behind him, and an attentive smile
upon his face.</p>

<p>"The universe," he observed, "makes rather
an indifferent parent, I am afraid."</p>

<p>"O! I don't know!" cried Mr. Skimpole,
buoyantly.</p>

<p>"I think I do know," said Mr. Jarndyce.</p>

<p>"Well!" cried Mr. Skimpole, "you know the
world (which in your sense is the universe), and
I know nothing of it, so you shall have your way.
But if I had mine," glancing at the cousins,
"there should be no brambles of sordid realities
in such a path as that. It should be strewn with
roses; it should lie through bowers, where there
was no spring, autumn, nor winter, but perpetual
summer. Age or change should never wither it.
The base word money should never be breathed
near it!"</p>

<p>Mr. Jarndyce patted him on the head with a
smile, as if he had been really a child; and passing
a step or two on, and stopping a moment,
glanced at the young cousins. His look was
thoughtful, but had a benignant expression in it
which I often (how often!) saw again: which
has long been engraven on my heart. The room
in which they were, communicating with that in
which he stood, was only lighted by the fire.
Ada sat at the piano; Richard stood beside her,
bending down. Upon the wall, their shadows
blended together, surrounded by strange forms,
not without a ghostly motion caught from the
unsteady fire, though reflected from motionless
objects. Ada touched the notes so softly, and
sang so low, that the wind, sighing away to the
distant hills, was as audible as the music. The
mystery of the future, and the little clew afforded
to it by the voice of the present, seemed expressed
in the whole picture.</p>

<p>But it is not to recall this fancy, well as I remember
it, that I recall the scene. First, I was
not quite unconscious of the contrast, in respect
of meaning and intention, between the silent look
directed that way, and the flow of words that had
preceded it. Secondly, though Mr. Jarndyce's
glance, as he withdrew it, rested for but a moment
on me, I felt as if, in that moment, he confided
to me&mdash;and knew that he confided to me, and
that I received the confidence&mdash;his hope that Ada
and Richard might one day enter on a dearer relationship.</p>

<p>Mr. Skimpole could play on the piano, and the
violoncello; and he was a composer&mdash;had composed
half an opera once, but got tired of it&mdash;and
played what he composed, with taste. After tea
we had quite a little concert, in which Richard&mdash;who
was enthralled by Ada's singing, and told me
that she seemed to know all the songs that ever
were written&mdash;and Mr. Jarndyce, and I, were the
audience. After a little while I missed, first Mr.
Skimpole, and afterward Richard; and while I
was thinking how could Richard stay away so
long, and lose so much, the maid who had given
me the keys looked in at the door, saying, "If
you please, miss, could you spare a minute?"</p>

<p>When I was shut out with her in the hall, she
said, holding up her hands, "Oh, if you please,
miss, Mr. Carstone says would you come up-stairs
to Mr. Skimpole's room. He has been took
miss!"</p>

<p>"Took?" said I.</p>

<p>"Took, miss. Sudden," said the maid.</p>

<p>I was apprehensive that his illness might be of
a dangerous kind; but, of course, I begged her to
be quiet and not disturb any one; and collected
myself, as I followed her quickly up-stairs, sufficiently
to consider what were the best remedies
to be applied if it should prove to be a fit. She
threw open a door, and I went into a chamber;
where, to my unspeakable surprise, instead of
finding Mr. Skimpole stretched upon the bed, or
prostrate on the floor, I found him standing before
the fire smiling at Richard, while Richard, with a
face of great embarrassment, looked at a person
on a sofa, in a white great coat, with smooth hair
upon his head and not much of it, which he was
wiping smoother, and making less of, with a
pocket-handkerchief.</p>

<p>"Miss Summerson," said Richard, hurriedly,
"I am glad you are come. You will be able to
advise us. Our friend, Mr. Skimpole&mdash;don't be
alarmed!&mdash;is arrested for debt."</p>

<p>"And, really, my dear Miss Summerson," said
Mr. Skimpole, with his agreeable candor, "I never
was in a situation, in which that excellent sense,
and quiet habit of method and usefulness, which
any body must observe in you who has the happiness
of being a quarter of an hour in your society,
was more needed."</p>

<p>The person on the sofa, who appeared to have
a cold in his head, gave such a very loud snort,
that he startled me.</p>

<p>"Are you arrested for much, sir?" I inquired
of Mr. Skimpole.</p>

<p>"My dear Miss Summerson," said he, shaking
his head pleasantly, "I don't know. Some
pounds, odd shillings, and halfpence, I think,
were mentioned.</p>

<p>"It's twenty-four pound, sixteen and seven
pence ha'penny," observed the stranger. "That's
wot it is."</p>

<p>"And it sounds&mdash;somehow it sounds," said
Mr. Skimpole, "like a small sum?"</p>

<p>The strange man said nothing, but made an
other snort. It was such a powerful one, that
it seemed quite to lift him up out of his seat.</p>

<p>"Mr. Skimpole," said Richard to me, "has a
delicacy in applying to my cousin Jarndyce, because
he has lately&mdash;I think, sir, I understood
you that you had lately&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh, yes!" returned Mr. Skimpole, smiling.
"Though I forgot how much it was, and when
it was. Jarndyce would readily do it again;
but I have the epicure-like feeling that I would
prefer a novelty in help; that I would rather,"
and he looked at Richard and me, "develop
generosity in a new soil, and in a new form of
flower."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_821" id="Page_821">[Pg 821]</a></span>
"What do you think will be best, Miss Summerson?"
said Richard, aside.</p>

<p>I ventured to inquire generally, before replying,
what would happen if the money were not
produced.</p>

<p>"Jail," said the strange man, coolly putting
his handkerchief into his hat, which was on the
floor at his feet. "Or Coavinses."</p>

<p>"May I ask, sir, what is&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Coavinses?" said the strange man. "A
'ouse."</p>

<p>Richard and I looked at one another again.
It was a most singular thing that the arrest was
our embarrassment, and not Mr. Skimpole's.
He observed us with a genial interest; but there
seemed, if I may venture on such a contradiction
nothing selfish in it. He had entirely washed his
hands of the difficulty, and it had become ours.</p>

<p>"I thought," he suggested, as if good-naturedly
to help us out, "that, being parties in a Chancery
suit concerning (as people say) a large
amount of property, Mr. Richard, or his beautiful
cousin, or both, could sign something, or make
over something, or give some sort of undertaking,
or pledge, or bond? I don't know what the
business name of it may be, but I suppose there
is some instrument within their power that would
settle this?"</p>

<p>"Not a bit on it," said the strange man.</p>

<p>"Really," returned Mr. Skimpole; "that seems
odd, now, to one who is no judge of these things!"</p>

<p>"Odd or even," said the stranger, gruffly, "I
tell you, not a bit on it!"</p>

<p>"Keep your temper, my good fellow, keep
your temper!" Mr. Skimpole gently reasoned
with him, as he made a little drawing of his
head on the fly-leaf of a book. "Don't be ruffled
by your occupation. We can separate you
from your office; we can separate the individual
from the pursuit. We are not so prejudiced as
to suppose that in private life you are otherwise
than a very estimable man, with a great deal
of poetry in your nature, of which you may not
be conscious."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_822" id="Page_822">[Pg 822]</a></span>
The stranger only answered with another violent
snort; whether in acceptance of the poetry-tribute,
or in disdainful rejection of it, he did not
express to me.</p>

<p>"Now, my dear Miss Summerson, and my
dear Mr. Richard," said Mr. Skimpole, gayly, innocently,
and confidingly, as he looked at his
drawing with his head on one side; "here you
see me utterly incapable of helping myself, and
entirely in your hands! I only ask to be free.
The butterflies are free. Mankind will surely not
deny to Harold Skimpole what it concedes to the
butterflies!"</p>

<p>"My dear Miss Summerson," said Richard, in
a whisper, "I have ten pounds that I received
from Mr. Kenge. I must try what that will
do."</p>

<p>I possessed fifteen pounds, odd shillings, which
I had saved from my quarterly allowance during
several years. I had always thought that some
accident might happen which would throw me,
suddenly, without any relation or any property,
on the world; and had always tried to keep some
little money by me, that I might not be quite
penniless. I told Richard of my having this little
store, and having no present need of it; and
I asked him delicately to inform Mr. Skimpole,
while I should be gone to fetch it, that we would
have the pleasure of paying his debt.</p>

<p>When I came back, Mr. Skimpole kissed my
hand, and seemed quite touched. Not on his
own account (I was again aware of that perplexing
and extraordinary contradiction), but on ours;
as if personal considerations were impossible
with him, and the contemplation of our happiness
alone affected him. Richard, begging me,
for the greater grace of the transaction, as he
said, to settle with Coavinses (as Mr. Skimpole
now jocularly called him), I counted out the
money and received the necessary acknowledgment.
This, too, delighted Mr. Skimpole.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 444px;">
<img src="images/ill-1852-may_illo_18.jpg" width="444" height="514" alt="COAVINSES." />
<span class="caption">COAVINSES.</span>
</div>

<p>His compliments were so delicately administered,
that I blushed less than I might have
done; and settled with the stranger in the white
coat, without making any mistakes. He put the
money in his pocket, and shortly said, "Well
then, I'll wish you a good-evening, miss."</p>

<p>"My friend," said Mr. Skimpole; standing with
his back to the fire, after giving up the sketch
when it was half finished, "I should like to ask
you something without offense."</p>

<p>I think the reply was, "Cut away, then!"</p>

<p>"Did you know this morning, now, that you
were coming out on this errand?" said Mr. Skimpole.</p>

<p>"Know'd it yes'day aft'noon at tea time,"
said Coavinses.</p>

<p>"It didn't affect your appetite? Didn't make
you at all uneasy?"</p>

<p>"Not a bit," said Coavinses. "I know'd if
you wos missed to-day, you wouldn't be missed
to-morrow. A day makes no such odds."</p>

<p>"But when you came down here," proceeded
Mr. Skimpole, "it was a fine day. The sun was
shining, the wind was blowing, the lights and
shadows were passing across the fields, the birds
were singing."</p>

<p>"Nobody said they warn't, in <i>my</i> hearing,"
returned Coavinses.</p>

<p>"No," observed Mr. Skimpole. "But what
did you think upon the road?"</p>

<p>"Wot do you mean?" growled Coavinses, with
an appearance of strong resentment. "Think!
I've got enough to do, and little enough to get for
it, without thinking. Thinking!" (with profound
contempt.)</p>

<p>"Then you didn't think, at all events," proceeded
Mr. Skimpole, "to this effect. 'Harold
Skimpole loves to see the sun shine; loves to
hear the wind blow; loves to watch the changing
lights and shadows; loves to hear the birds, those
choristers in Nature's great cathedral. And does
it seem to me that I am about to deprive Harold
Skimpole of his share in such possessions, which
are his only birthright!' You thought nothing
to that effect?"</p>

<p>"I&mdash;certainly&mdash;did&mdash;<span class="smcap">not</span>," said Coavinses,
whose doggedness in utterly renouncing the idea
was of that intense kind, that he could only give
adequate expression to it by putting a long interval
between each word, and accompanying the last
with a jerk that might have dislocated his neck.</p>

<p>"Very odd and very curious, the mental process
is, in you men of business!" said Mr. Skimpole,
thoughtfully. "Thank you, my friend.
Good-night."</p>

<p>As our absence had been long enough already,
to seem strange down stairs, I returned at once,
and found Ada sitting at work by the fireside
talking to her cousin John. Mr. Skimpole presently
appeared, and Richard shortly after him.
I was sufficiently engaged, during the remainder
of the evening, in taking my first lesson in backgammon
from Mr. Jarndyce, who was very fond
of the game, and from whom I wished of course
to learn it as quickly as I could, in order that I
might be of the very small use of being able to
play when he had no better adversary. But I
thought, occasionally when Mr. Skimpole played
some fragments of his own compositions; or
when, both at the piano and the violoncello, and
at our table, he preserved, with an absence of all
effort, his delightful spirits and his easy flow of
conversation; that Richard and I seemed to retain
the transferred impression of having been arrested
since dinner, and that it was very curious
altogether.</p>

<p>It was late before we separated: for when Ada
was going at eleven o'clock, Mr. Skimpole went
to the piano, and rattled, hilariously, that the best
of all ways, to lengthen our days, was to steal a
few hours from Night, my dear! It was past
twelve before he took his candle and his radiant
face out of the room; and I think he might have
kept us there, if he had seen fit, until daybreak.
Ada and Richard were lingering for a few moments
by the fire, wondering whether Mrs. Jellyby
had yet finished her dictation for the day,
when Mr. Jarndyce, who had been out of the
room, returned.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_823" id="Page_823">[Pg 823]</a></span>
"Oh, dear me, what's this, what's this?" he
said, rubbing his head and walking about with
his good-humored vexation. "What's this, they
tell me? Rick, my boy, Esther, my dear, what
have you been doing? Why did you do it? How
could you do it? How much apiece was it?&mdash;The
wind's round again. I feel it all over me!"</p>

<p>We neither of us quite knew what to answer.</p>

<p>"Come, Rick, come! I must settle this before
I sleep. How much are you out of pocket? You
two made the money up you know! Why did
you? How could you?&mdash;O Lord, yes, it's due
east&mdash;must be!"</p>

<p>"Really, sir," said Richard, "I don't think it
would be honorable in me to tell you. Mr. Skimpole
relied upon us&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Lord bless you, my dear boy! He relies upon
every body!" said Mr. Jarndyce, giving his head
a great rub, and stopping short.</p>

<p>"Indeed, sir?"</p>

<p>"Every body! And he'll be in the same scrape
again, next week!" said Mr. Jarndyce, walking
again at a great pace, with a candle in his hand
that had gone out. "He's always in the same
scrape. He was born in the same scrape. I
verily believe that the announcement in the newspapers
when his mother was confined, was 'On
Tuesday last, at her residence in Botheration
Buildings, Mrs. Skimpole of a son in difficulties.'"</p>

<p>Richard laughed heartily, but added, "Still,
sir, I don't want to shake his confidence, or to break
his confidence; and if I submit to your better
knowledge again, that I ought to keep his secret,
I hope you will consider before you press me any
more. Of course, if you do press me, sir, I shall
know I am wrong, and will tell you."</p>

<p>"Well!" cried Mr. Jarndyce, stopping again,
and making several absent endeavors to put his
candlestick in his pocket. "I&mdash;here! Take it
away, my dear. I don't know what I am about
with it; it's all the wind&mdash;invariably has that
effect&mdash;I won't press you, Rick; you may be
right. But, really&mdash;to get hold of you and Esther&mdash;and
to squeeze you like a couple of tender
young Saint Michael's oranges!&mdash;It'll blow a gale
in the course of the night!"</p>

<p>He was now alternately putting his hands into
his pockets, as if he were going to keep them
there a long time; and taking them out again,
and vehemently rubbing them all over his head.</p>

<p>I ventured to take this opportunity of hinting
that Mr. Skimpole, being in all such matters quite
a child&mdash;</p>

<p>"Eh, my dear?" said Mr. Jarndyce catching
at the word.</p>

<p>"&mdash;Being quite a child, sir," said I, "and so
different from other people&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You are right!" said Mr. Jarndyce, brightening.
"Your woman's wit hits the mark. He
is a child&mdash;an absolute child. I told you he was
a child, you know, when I first mentioned him."</p>

<p>"Certainly! certainly!" we said.</p>

<p>"And he <i>is</i> a child. Now isn't he?" asked
Mr. Jarndyce, brightening more and more.</p>

<p>He was indeed, we said.</p>

<p>"When you come to think of it, it's the height
of childishness in you&mdash;I mean me&mdash;" said Mr.
Jarndyce, "to regard him for a moment as a man.
You can't make <i>him</i> responsible. The idea of
Harold Skimpole with designs or plans, or knowledge
of consequences! Ha, ha, ha!"</p>

<p>It was so delicious to see the clouds about his
face clearing, and to see him so heartily pleased,
and to know, as it was impossible not to know,
that the source of his pleasure was the goodness
which was tortured by condemning, or mistrusting,
or secretly accusing any one, that I saw the
tears in Ada's eyes while she echoed his laugh,
and felt them in my own.</p>

<p>"Why, what a cod's head and shoulders I am,"
said Mr. Jarndyce, "to require reminding of it!
The whole business shows the child from beginning
to end. Nobody but a child would have
thought of singling <i>you</i> two out for parties in the
affair! Nobody but a child would have thought
of <i>your</i> having the money! If it had been a
thousand pounds, it would have been just the
same!" said Mr. Jarndyce, with his whole face
in a glow.</p>

<p>We all confirmed it from our night's experience.</p>

<p>"To be sure, to be sure!" said Mr. Jarndyce.
"However, Rick, Esther, and you too, Ada, for
I don't know that even your little purse is safe
from his inexperience&mdash;I must have a promise all
round, that nothing of this sort shall ever be done
anymore. No advances! Not even sixpences."</p>

<p>We all promised faithfully; Richard, with a
merry glance at me, touching his pocket, as if to
remind me that there was no danger of <i>our</i> transgressing.</p>

<p>"As to Skimpole," said Mr. Jarndyce, "a habitable
doll's house, with good board, and a few
tin people to get into debt with and borrow money
of, would set the boy up in life. He is in a child's
sleep by this time, I suppose; it's time I should
take my craftier head to my more worldly pillow.
Good-night, my dears. God bless you!"</p>

<p>He peeped in again, with a smiling face, before
we had lighted our candles, and said, "O! I
have been looking at the weather-cock. I find it
was a false alarm about the wind. It's in the
south!" And went away, singing to himself.</p>

<p>Ada and I agreed, as we talked together for a
little while up-stairs, that this caprice about the
wind was a fiction; and that he used the pretense
to account for any disappointment he could
not conceal, rather than he would blame the real
cause of it, or disparage or depreciate any one.
We thought this very characteristic of his eccentric
gentleness; and of the difference between him
and those petulant people who make the weather
and the winds (particularly that unlucky wind
which he had chosen for such a different purpose)
the stalking-horse of their splenetic and gloomy
humors.</p>

<p>Indeed, so much affection for him had been added
in this one evening to my gratitude, that I
hoped I already began to understand him through
that mingled feeling. Any seeming inconsistencies
in Mr. Skimpole, or in Mrs. Jellyby, I could<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_824" id="Page_824">[Pg 824]</a></span>
not expect to be able to reconcile; having so little
experience or practical knowledge. Neither
did I try; for my thoughts were busy when I was
alone, with Ada and Richard, and with the confidence
I had seemed to receive concerning them.
My fancy, made a little wild by the wind perhaps,
would not consent to be all unselfish either, though
I would have persuaded it to be so if I could. It
wandered back to my godmother's house, and
came along the intervening track, raising up
shadowy speculations which had sometimes trembled
there in the dark, as to what knowledge Mr.
Jarndyce had of my earliest history&mdash;even as to
the possibility of his being my father&mdash;though that
idle dream was quite gone now.</p>

<p>It was all gone now, I remembered, getting up
from the fire. It was not for me to muse over
bygones, but to act with a cheerful spirit and a
grateful heart. So I said to myself, "Esther,
Esther, Esther! Duty, my dear!" and gave my
little basket of housekeeping keys such a shake,
that they sounded like little bells, and rang me
hopefully to bed.</p>


<h3>CHAPTER VII.&mdash;<span class="smcap">The Ghost's Walk.</span></h3>

<p>While Esther sleeps, and while Esther wakes,
it is still wet weather down at the place in Lincolnshire.
The rain is ever falling, drip, drip,
drip, by day and night, upon the broad flag terrace-pavement,
The Ghost's Walk. The weather is
so very bad, down in Lincolnshire, that the liveliest
imagination can scarcely apprehend its ever
being fine again. Not that there is any superabundant
life of imagination on the spot, for Sir
Leicester is not here (and, truly, even if he were,
would not do much for it in that particular), but
is in Paris with my Lady; and solitude, with
dusky wings, sits brooding upon Chesney Wold.</p>

<p>There may be some notions of fancy among the
lower animals at Chesney Wold. The horses in
the stables&mdash;the long stables in a barren, red-brick
court-yard, where there is a great bell in a turret,
and a clock with a large face, which the pigeons
who live near it, and who love to perch upon its
shoulders, seem to be always consulting&mdash;<i>they</i>
may contemplate some mental pictures of fine
weather, on occasions, and may be better artists
at them than the grooms. The old roan, so famous
for cross-country work, turning his large
eyeball to the grated window near his rack, may
remember the fresh leaves that glisten there at
other times, and the scents that stream in, and
may have a fine run with the hounds, while the
human helper, clearing out the next stall, never
stirs beyond his pitchfork and birch-broom. The
gray, whose place is opposite the door, and who,
with an impatient rattle of his halter, pricks his
ears, and turns his head so wistfully when it is
opened, and to whom the opener says, "Woa
gray, then, steady! Noabody wants you to-day!"
may know it quite as well as the man. The
whole seemingly monotonous and uncompanionable
half-dozen, stabled together, may pass the
long wet hours, when the door is shut, in livelier
communication than is held in the servants' hall,
or at the Dedlock Arms; or may even beguile the
time by improving (perhaps corrupting) the pony
in the loose box in the corner.</p>

<p>So the mastiff, dozing in his kennel, in the
court-yard, with his large head on his paws, may
think of the hot sunshine, when the shadows of
the stable-buildings tire his patience out by changing,
and leave him, at one time of the day, no
broader refuge than the shadow of his own house,
where he sits on end, panting and growling short,
and very much wanting something to worry, besides
himself and chain. So now, half-waking
and all-winking, he may recall the house full of
company, the coach-houses full of vehicles, the
stables full of horses, and the outbuildings full
of attendants upon horses, until he is undecided
about the present, and comes forth to see how it
is. Then, with an impatient shake of himself,
he may growl, in the spirit, "Rain, rain, rain!
Nothing but rain&mdash;and no family here!" as he
goes in again, and lies down with a gloomy yawn.</p>

<p>So with the dogs in the kennel-buildings across
the park, who have their restless fits, and whose
doleful voices, when the wind has been very obstinate,
have even made it known in the house itself:
up-stairs, down stairs, and in my lady's chamber.
They may hunt the whole country-side, while
the rain-drops are pattering round their inactivity.
So the rabbits with their self-betraying tails, frisking
in and out of holes at roots of trees, may be
lively with ideas of the breezy days when their
ears are blown about, or of those seasons of interest
when there are sweet young plants to gnaw.
The turkey in the poultry-yard, always troubled
with a class-grievance (probably Christmas), may
be reminiscent of that summer morning wrongfully
taken from him, when he got into the lane
among the felled trees, where there was a barn
and barley. The discontented goose, who stoops
to pass under the old gateway, twenty feet high,
may gabble out, if we only knew it, a waddling
preference for weather when the gateway casts
its shadow on the ground.</p>

<p>Be this as it may, there is not much fancy
otherwise stirring at Chesney Wold. If there be
a little at any odd moment, it goes, like a little
noise in that old echoing place, a long way, and
usually leads off to ghosts and mystery.</p>

<p>It has rained so hard and rained so long, down
in Lincolnshire, that Mrs. Rouncewell, the old
housekeeper at Chesney Wold, has several times
taken off her spectacles and cleaned them, to
make certain that the drops were not upon the
glasses. Mrs. Rouncewell might have been sufficiently
assured by hearing the rain, but that she
is rather deaf, which nothing will induce her to
believe. She is a fine old lady, handsome, stately,
wonderfully neat, and has such a back, and such
a stomacher, that if her stays should turn out
when she dies to have been a broad old-fashioned
family fire-grate, nobody who knows her would
have cause to be surprised. Weather affects Mrs.
Rouncewell little. The house is there in all
weathers, and the house, as she expresses it, "is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_825" id="Page_825">[Pg 825]</a></span>
what she looks at." She sits in her room (in a
side passage on the ground floor, with an arched
window commanding a smooth quadrangle, adorned
at regular intervals with smooth round trees
and smooth round blocks of stone, as if the trees
were going to play at bowls with the stones),
and the whole house reposes on her mind. She
can open it on occasion, and be busy and fluttered;
but it is shut-up now, and lies on the breadth
of Mrs. Rouncewell's iron-bound bosom, in a
majestic sleep.</p>

<p>It is the next difficult thing to an impossibility
to imagine Chesney Wold without Mrs. Rouncewell,
but she has only been here fifty years. Ask
her how long, this rainy day, and she shall answer,
"fifty year three months and a fortnight,
by the blessing of Heaven, if I live 'till Tuesday."
Mr. Rouncewell died some time before the decease
of the pretty fashion of pig-tails, and modestly
hid his own (if he took it with him) in a
corner of the church-yard in the park, near the
mouldy porch. He was born in the market town,
and so was his young widow. Her progress in
the family began in the time of the last Sir Leicester,
and originated in the still-room.</p>

<p>The present representative of the Dedlocks is
an excellent master. He supposes all his dependents
to be utterly bereft of individual characters,
intentions, or opinions, and is persuaded
that he was born to supersede the necessity of
their having any. If he were to make a discovery
to the contrary, he would be simply stunned&mdash;would
never recover himself, most likely, except
to gasp and die. But he is an excellent master
still, holding it a part of his state to be so. He
has a great liking for Mrs. Rouncewell; he says
she is a most respectable, creditable woman. He
always shakes hands with her, when he comes
down to Chesney Wold, and when he goes away;
and if he were very ill, or if he were knocked
down by accident, or run over, or placed in any
situation expressive of a Dedlock at a disadvantage,
he would say if he could speak, "Leave me,
and send Mrs. Rouncewell here!" feeling his dignity,
at such a pass, safer with her than with any
body else.</p>

<p>Mrs. Rouncewell has known trouble. She has
had two sons, of whom the younger ran wild,
and went for a soldier, and never came back.
Even to this hour, Mrs. Rouncewell's calm hands
lose their composure when she speaks of him,
and unfolding themselves from her stomacher,
hover about her in an agitated manner, as she
says, what a likely lad, what a fine lad, what a
gay, good-humored, clever lad he was! Her
second son would have been provided for at Chesney
Wold, and would have been made steward in
due season; but he took, when he was a schoolboy,
to constructing steam-engines out of sauce-pans,
and setting birds to draw their own water,
with the least possible amount of labor; so assisting
them with artful contrivance of hydraulic
pressure, that a thirsty canary had only, in a literal
sense, to put his shoulder to the wheel, and
the job was done. This propensity gave Mrs.
Rouncewell great uneasiness. She felt it with a
mother's anguish, to be a move in the Wat Tyler
direction: well knowing that Sir Leicester had
that general impression of an aptitude for any
art to which smoke and a tall chimney might be
considered essential. But the doomed young rebel
(otherwise a mild youth, and very persevering),
showing no sign of grace as he got older,
but, on the contrary, constructing a model of a
power-loom, she was fain, with many tears, to
mention his backslidings to the baronet. "Mrs.
Rouncewell," said Sir Leicester, "I can never
consent to argue, as you know, with any one on
any subject. You had better get rid of your boy,
you had better get him into some Works. The
iron country farther north is, I suppose, the congenial
direction for a boy with these tendencies."
Farther north he went, and farther north he grew
up; and if Sir Leicester Dedlock ever saw him,
when he came to Chesney Wold to visit his
mother, or ever thought of him afterward, it is
certain that he only regarded him as one of a
body of some odd thousand conspirators, swarthy
and grim, who were in the habit of turning out
by torch-light, two or three nights in the week,
for unlawful purposes.</p>

<p>Nevertheless Mrs. Rouncewell's son has, in the
course of nature and art, grown up, and established
himself, and married, and called unto him
Mrs. Rouncewell's grandson: who, being out of
his apprenticeship, and home from a journey in
far countries, whither he was sent to enlarge his
knowledge and complete his preparation for the
venture of this life, stands leaning against the
chimney-piece this very day, in Mrs. Rouncewell's
room at Chesney Wold.</p>

<p>"And, again and again, I am glad to see you,
Watt! And, once again, I am glad to see you,
Watt!" says Mrs. Rouncewell. "You are a fine
young fellow. You are like your poor uncle George.
Ah!" Mrs. Rouncewell's hands unquiet, as usual,
on this reference.</p>

<p>"They say I am like my father, grandmother."</p>

<p>"Like him, also, my dear&mdash;but most like your
poor uncle George! And your dear father."
Mrs. Rouncewell folds her hands again. "He
is well?"</p>

<p>"Thriving, grandmother, in every way."</p>

<p>"I am thankful!" Mrs. Rouncewell is fond
of her son, but has a plaintive feeling toward
him&mdash;much as if he were a very honorable soldier,
who had gone over to the enemy.</p>

<p>"He is quite happy?" says she.</p>

<p>"Quite."</p>

<p>"I am thankful! So, he has brought you up
to follow in his ways, and has sent you into foreign
countries and the like? Well, he knows
best. There may be a world beyond Chesney
Wold that I don't understand. Though I am
not young, either. And I have seen a quantity
of good company too!"</p>

<p>"Grandmother," says the young man, changing
the subject, "what a very pretty girl that
was, I found with you just now. You called her
Rosa?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_826" id="Page_826">[Pg 826]</a></span>
"Yes, child. She is daughter of a widow in
the village. Maids are so hard to teach, nowadays,
that I have put her about me young. She's
an apt scholar, and will do well. She shows the
house already, very pretty. She lives with me,
at my table here."</p>

<p>"I hope I have not driven her away?"</p>

<p>"She supposes we have family affairs to speak
about, I dare say. She is very modest. It is a
fine quality in a young woman. And scarcer,"
says Mrs. Rouncewell, expanding her stomacher
to its utmost limits, "than it formerly was!"</p>

<p>The young man inclines his head, in acknowledgment
of the precepts of experience. Mrs.
Rouncewell listens.</p>

<p>"Wheels!" says she. They have long been
audible to the younger ears of her companion.
"What wheels on such a day as this, for gracious
sake?"</p>

<p>After a short interval, a tap at the door.
"Come in!" A dark-eyed, dark-haired, shy,
village beauty comes in&mdash;so fresh in her rosy and
yet delicate bloom, that the drops of rain, which
have beaten on her hair, look like the dew upon
a flower fresh-gathered.</p>

<p>"What company is this, Rosa?" says Mrs.
Rouncewell.</p>

<p>"It's two young men in a gig, ma'am, who
want to see the house&mdash;yes, and if you please, I
told them so!" in quick reply to a gesture of
dissent from the housekeeper. "I went to the
half-door, and told them it was the wrong day,
and the wrong hour; but the young man who
was driving took off his hat in the wet, and begged
me to bring this card to you."</p>

<p>"Read it, my dear Watt," said the housekeeper.</p>

<p>Rosa is so shy as she gives it to him, that they
drop it between them, and almost knock their
foreheads together as they pick it up. Rosa is
shyer than before.</p>

<p>"Mr. Guppy," is all the information the card
yields.</p>

<p>"Guppy!" repeats Mrs. Rouncewell. "Mr.
Guppy! Nonsense, I never heard of him!"</p>

<p>"If you please, he told <i>me</i> that!" says Rosa.
"But he said that he and the other young gentleman
came from London only last night by the
mail, on business at the magistrates' meeting
ten miles off, this morning; and that as their
business was soon over, and they had heard a
great deal said of Chesney Wold, and really didn't
know what to do with themselves, they had come
through the wet to see it. They are lawyers. He
says he is not in Mr. Tulkinghorn's office, but
is sure he may make use of Mr. Tulkinghorn's
name, if necessary." Finding, now she leaves
off, that she has been making quite a long speech,
Rosa is shyer than ever.</p>

<p>Now, Mr. Tulkinghorn is, in a manner, part
and parcel of the place; and, besides, is supposed
to have made Mrs. Rouncewell's will. The old
lady relaxes, consents to the admission of the
visitors as a favor, and dismisses Rosa. The
grandson, however, being smitten by a sudden
wish to see the house himself, proposes to join
the party. The grandmother, who is pleased
that he should have that interest, accompanies
him&mdash;though, to do him justice, he is exceedingly
unwilling to trouble her.</p>

<p>"Much obliged to you, ma'am!" says Mr.
Guppy, divesting himself of his wet dreadnought
in the hall. "Us London lawyers don't often
get an out; and when we do, we like to make
the most of it, you know."</p>

<p>The old housekeeper, with a gracious severity
of deportment, waves her hand toward the great
staircase. Mr. Guppy and his friend follow Rosa,
Mrs. Rouncewell and her grandson follow them,
a young gardener goes before to open the shutters.</p>

<p>As is usually the case with people who go over
houses, Mr. Guppy and his friend are dead beat
before they have well begun. They straggle
about in wrong places, look at wrong things,
don't care for the right things, gape when more
rooms are opened, exhibit profound depression of
spirits, and are clearly knocked up. In each successive
chamber that they enter, Mrs. Rouncewell,
who is as upright as the house itself, rests
apart in a window-seat, or other such nook, and
listens with stately approval to Rosa's exposition.
Her grandson is so attentive to it, that Rosa is
shyer than ever&mdash;and prettier. Thus they pass
on from room to room, raising the pictured Dedlocks
for a few brief minutes as the young gardener
admits the light, and reconsigning them to
their graves as he shuts it out again. It appears
to the afflicted Mr. Guppy and his inconsolable
friend, that there is no end to the Dedlocks, whose
family-greatness seems to consist in their never
having done any thing to distinguish themselves,
for seven hundred years.</p>

<p>Even the long drawing-room of Chesney Wold
can not revive Mr. Guppy's spirits. He is so
low that he droops on the threshold, and has
hardly strength of mind to enter. But a portrait
over the chimney-piece, painted by the fashionable
artist of the day, acts upon him like a charm.
He recovers in a moment. He stares at it with
uncommon interest; he seems to be fixed and
fascinated by it.</p>

<p>"Dear me!" says Mr. Guppy. "Who's that?"</p>

<p>"The picture over the fire-place," says Rosa,
"is the portrait of the present Lady Dedlock. It
is considered a perfect likeness, and the best
work of the master."</p>

<p>"'Blest!" says Mr. Guppy, staring in a kind
of dismay at his friend, "if I can ever have seen
her. Yet I know her! Has the picture been
engraved, miss?"</p>

<p>"The picture has never been engraved. Sir
Leicester has always refused permission."</p>

<p>"Well!" says Mr. Guppy, in a low voice, "I'll
be shot if it an't very curious how well I know
that picture! So that's Lady Dedlock, is it?"</p>

<p>"The picture on the right is the present Sir
Leicester Dedlock. The picture on the left is his
father, the late Sir Leicester."</p>

<p>Mr. Guppy has no eyes for either of these magnates.
"It's unaccountable to me," he says, still<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_827" id="Page_827">[Pg 827]</a></span>
staring at the portrait, "how well I know that
picture! I'm dashed!" adds Mr. Guppy, looking
round, "if I don't think I must have had a
dream of that picture, you know!"</p>

<p>As no one present takes any especial interest
in Mr. Guppy's dreams, the probability is not
pursued. But he still remains so absorbed by
the portrait, that he stands immovable before it
until the young gardener has closed the shutters;
when he comes out of the room in a dazed state,
that is an odd though a sufficient substitute for
interest, and follows into the succeeding rooms
with a confused stare, as if he were looking every
where for Lady Dedlock again.</p>

<p>He sees no more of her. He sees her rooms,
which are the last shown, as being very elegant,
and he looks out of the windows from which she
looked out, not long ago, upon the weather that
bored her to death. All things have an end&mdash;even
houses that people take infinite pains to
see, and are tired of before they begin to see
them. He has come to the end of the sight, and
the fresh village beauty to the end of her description;
which is always this:</p>

<p>"The terrace below is much admired. It is
called, from an old story in the family, The
Ghost's Walk."</p>

<p>"No?" says Mr. Guppy, greedily curious;
"what's the story, miss? Is it any thing about
a picture?"</p>

<p>"Pray tell us the story," says Watt, in a half
whisper.</p>

<p>"I don't know it, sir." Rosa is shyer than
ever.</p>

<p>"It is not related to visitors; it is almost forgotten,"
says the housekeeper, advancing, "It
has never been more than a family anecdote."</p>

<p>"You'll excuse my asking again if it has any
thing to do with a picture, ma'am," observes
Mr. Guppy, "because I do assure you that the
more I think of that picture the better I know it,
without knowing how I know it!"</p>

<p>The story has nothing to do with a picture;
the housekeeper can guarantee that. Mr. Guppy
is obliged to her for the information; and is moreover,
generally obliged. He retires with his
friend, guided down another staircase by the
young gardener; and presently is heard to drive
away. It is now dusk. Mrs. Rouncewell can
trust to the discretion of her two young hearers,
and may tell <i>them</i> how the terrace came to have
that ghostly name. She seats herself in a large
chair by the fast-darkening window, and tells
them:</p>

<p>"In the wicked days, my dears, of King Charles
the First&mdash;I mean, of course, in the wicked days
of the rebels who leagued themselves against that
excellent King&mdash;Sir Morbury Dedlock was the
owner of Chesney Wold. Whether there was
any account of a ghost in the family before those
days, I can't say. I should think it very likely
indeed."</p>

<p>Mrs. Rouncewell holds this opinion, because
she considers that a family of such antiquity and
importance has a right to a ghost. She regards
a ghost as one of the privileges of the upper
classes; a genteel distinction to which the common
people have no claim.</p>

<p>"Sir Morbury Dedlock," says Mrs. Rouncewell,
"was, I have no occasion to say, on the
side of the blessed martyr. But it <i>is</i> supposed
that his lady, who had none of the family blood
in her veins, favored the bad cause. It is said
that she had relations among King Charles's
enemies; that she was in correspondence with
them; and that she gave them information.
When any of the country gentlemen who followed
His Majesty's cause met here, it is said that my
lady was always nearer to the door of their
council-room than they supposed. Do you hear
a sound like a footstep passing along the terrace,
Watt?"</p>

<p>Rosa draws nearer to the housekeeper.</p>

<p>"I hear the rain-drip on the stones," replies
the young man, "and I hear a curious echo&mdash;I
suppose an echo&mdash;which is very like a halting
step."</p>

<p>The housekeeper gravely nods and continues.</p>

<p>"Partly on account of this division between
them, and partly on other accounts, Sir Morbury
and his lady led a troubled life. She was a lady
of a haughty temper. They were not well suited
to each other in age or character, and they had
no children to moderate between them. After
her favorite brother, a young gentleman, was
killed in the civil wars (by Sir Morbury's near
kinsman), her feeling was so violent that she
hated the race into which she had married.
When the Dedlocks were about to ride out from
Chesney Wold in the King's cause, she is supposed
to have more than once stolen down into
the stables in the dead of night, and lamed their
horses; and the story is, that once, at such an
hour, her husband saw her gliding down the
stairs, and followed her into the stall where his
own favorite horse stood. There he seized her
by the wrist; and in a struggle or in a fall, or
through the horse being frightened and lashing
out, she was lamed in the hip, and from that
hour began to pine away."</p>

<p>The housekeeper has dropped her voice to little
more than a whisper.</p>

<p>"She had been a lady of a handsome figure
and a noble carriage. She never complained of
the change; she never spoke to any one of being
crippled, or of being in pain; but, day by day,
she tried to walk upon the terrace; and, with
the help of a stick, and with the help of the stone
balustrade, went up and down, up and down, up
and down, in sun and shadow, with greater difficulty
every day. At last, one afternoon, her husband
(to whom she had never, on any persuasion,
opened her lips since that night), standing at the
great south window, saw her drop upon the pavement.
He hastened down to raise her, but she
repulsed him as he bent over her, and looking
at him fixedly and coldly, said, 'I will die here,
where I have walked. And I will walk here,
though I am in my grave. I will walk here until
the pride of this house is humbled. And when<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_828" id="Page_828">[Pg 828]</a></span>
calamity, or when disgrace is coming to it, let
the Dedlocks listen for my step!'"</p>

<p>Watt looks at Rosa. Rosa, in the deepening
gloom, looks down upon the ground, half frightened,
and half shy.</p>

<p>"There and then she died. And from those
days," says Mrs. Rouncewell, "the name has
come down&mdash;The Ghost's Walk. If the tread is
an echo, it is an echo that is only heard after
dark, and is often unheard for a long while together.
But it comes back, from time to time;
and so sure as there is sickness or death in the
family, it will be heard then."</p>

<p>"&mdash;And disgrace, grandmother&mdash;" says Watt.</p>

<p>"Disgrace never comes to Chesney Wold," returns
the housekeeper.</p>

<p>Her grandson apologizes, with "True. True."</p>

<p>"That is the story. Whatever the sound is,
it is a worrying sound," says Mrs. Rouncewell,
getting up from her chair, "and what is to be
noticed in it is, that it <i>must be heard</i>. My lady,
who is afraid of nothing, admits that when it is
there, it must be heard. You can not shut it
out. Watt, there is a tall French clock behind
you (placed there, a' purpose) that has a loud
beat when it is in motion, and can play music.
You understand how those things are managed?"</p>

<p>"Pretty well, grandmother, I think."</p>

<p>"Set it a-going."</p>

<p>Watt sets it a-going&mdash;music and all.</p>

<p>"Now, come hither," says the housekeeper.
"Hither, child, toward my lady's pillow. I am
not sure that it is dark enough yet, but listen!
Can you hear the sound upon the terrace, through
the music, and the beat, and every thing?"</p>

<p>"I certainly can!"</p>

<p>"So my lady says."</p>

<h2>THE RUSSIAN CZAR AT A PUBLIC BALL.</h2>


<p>To provide resources for the invalids of the
Russian army, great care is taken; and in
addition to more fixed estimates, the emperor
makes extraordinary exertions, by balls, and lotteries,
and masquerades, of a charitable nature,
to augment the ways and means of the veterans
who have been disabled in his service. Sometimes
the ball, the lottery, and the masquerade
are all combined in one festive display. Of course,
such displays take place in winter, which is the
St. Petersburg season. It is not two years since
I was present on one of these occasions, round
which the emperor threw all the attractions of
his gorgeous court. And, as the festivities were
for the especial benefit of the military invalids, I
may be excused for lingering for awhile on the
details which I witnessed. Besides, often as the
emperor, who is the real commander-in-chief of
all the Russian forces, has been described, the
subject is far from being picked to the bone; and
what I saw of him it will gratify the curiosity of
the reader to learn.</p>

<p>It is the military frequenters, with their prodigious
variety of costumes, who give so much
splendor to the celebrated masquerades of St.
Petersburg. These are conducted on the model
of the still more celebrated masquerades of old,
in Venice. The approximation is the less complete,
of course, because the climate is so different.
Open-air assemblies, for pleasure's sake,
are out of the question, in a northern winter.
The merry-makers would have little else to do
but rub each other's noses with snow, to prevent
their falling off gradually after they had been
bleached by the leprous-looking frost-bite. There
are nights when it is hardly an exaggeration to
say that, if a person spits out, it is a pellet of
ice which rattles against the ground. The sudden
transition from such a winter to the intense
heat of the Petersburg summer is one among
several conditions which render a residence in
that capital so unfriendly to the health of foreigners,
unless they come in the plastic time of
childhood, and grow, with many precautions, acclimatized.</p>

<p>The place of assembly for these great festive
or charitable demonstrations (the only kind of
"demonstration," except such as are military,
which can be seen in Russia) is not unworthy
of its purposes. It is probably the finest of its
kind in Europe or in the world, and is called the
"Hall of Nobility"&mdash;<i>Salle de Noblesse</i>&mdash;a vast
edifice, capable of receiving seven thousand
guests, supported inside by splendid scagliola
columns, richly decorated, skillfully laid out, distributed
into a vast pit for dancing, with circumambient
galleries and balconies, with retiring or
withdrawing apartments for the emperor and his
court, and with general refreshment-rooms in the
outer circuit. This scene is lit up by clusters
of wax-lights the beams of which are multiplied
by crystal pendants; while the wax-lights themselves
are many thousands in number, more
numerous, in fact, than the stars visible to the
naked eye on a bright frosty night.</p>

<p>A great masquerade ball for the benefit of the
invalids, in such a place, with the additional attraction
of the promised presence of the Emperor
Nicholas, was irresistible. I determined to go,
and my determination was the more natural inasmuch
as I happened to possess a free ticket.
On entering, I was struck by the novel and somewhat
grotesque feature imparted to the scene by
the lottery prizes, which had lain there "on
view" for some days previously. I found a
crowd which was afterward estimated at seven
thousand; but, I dare say, it numbered five or
six only.</p>

<p>Perfectly lost in the vastness of the place, the
multitude assembled, and the grotesque horror
of beautiful forms without human faces, I sat
down for awhile, near the orchestra. The
benches, on one of which I was, rose here in
successive tiers, from the vast, pit-like saloon to
the surrounding gallery, which was overhung by
another gallery, and abutted upon several splendid
refreshment-rooms. Before and below, the
crowd was particularly dense around a little rostrum,
on which a glass wheel and several officials
who plied it, stood together. The press, the
throng, the hustling, the jostling, the redness of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_829" id="Page_829">[Pg 829]</a></span>
faces where they could be seen, and the activity
of elbows where they could be insidiously inserted,
were raging around. A similar apparatus,
besieged by similar votaries, stood at the other
three corners of the saloon. In the ancillary
apartments there were more of these shrines of
gambling; a gambling in which only one class
was sure to win, a class unvexed by the excitement
of the game, the invalided veterans, the
brave old disabled soldiers of the empire. For
their sakes was all this gorgeous commotion; for
their sakes this splendid mob bustled about the
"<i>Ailetpii Allegri</i>;" that is, the wheels of fortune,
the lottery stands, the stalls of fate. All round
these, and between them, circulated the pervading
immensity of the masquerade.</p>

<p>Tired of this part of the scene, I asked the
person next me, in what part of the room the
emperor was. I had already seen Alexander,
the crown prince, or, as he is called, the <i>Grand
Duc H&eacute;ritier</i>, walking about with a lady on his
arm, his handsome open countenance radiant
with the smiles that are so easily lit there.</p>

<p>"The emperor," said the person whom I had
asked, "passed this way about a quarter of an
hour since, and must be somewhere yonder,"
and he pointed to the end of the saloon, opposite
the orchestra.</p>

<p>I arose, ascended the flights of stairs that conducted
to the Boulevard-like gallery, and I began
to thread my way behind the scagliola columns.
Beyond these, across the width of the
corridor, arose the wall which was the running
boundary of the corridor on the other side; and
into this wall were let tall mirrors, which multiplied
every particular of the confused and shifting
splendor of the rooms.</p>

<p>When I reached the further end of the gallery,
a spectacle was offered to me, which arrested all
my attention. I must premise, that when the
emperor attends these festivities, or others of a
like nature, he evinces certain likings, feelings,
tastes. He is not entirely indifferent as to what
his subjects may do. If there be one thing more
than another which he abhors, it is that in these
scenes of familiar relaxation, in which he mingles
to unbend his own mind, while contributing
indirectly a new interest to the revels of others,
he should be saluted as emperor, or beset by the
unmannerly siege of a universal stare. It is
strictly understood, or, as the fashionable jargon
is, <i>de rigueur</i>, that he is present as any other
stranger, not to be noted, not to be quoted, quite
incognitus. Here he comes, like any one else,
to amuse himself, to forget imperial cares for a
brief moment. Nothing pleases him more than
to let him pass. Can he not be as any other of
the countless visitors, who engage in the intricate
tactics of these grave and sober saturnalia&mdash;this
game of small mystery&mdash;this strategic maze of
hushed frolic&mdash;these profound combinations of
grown-up gentlemen and ladies at hide-and-seek?</p>

<p>I had easily figured to myself, that it was
easier for the emperor to let people know that
such was his wish, than for others to affect an
unconsciousness which they did not feel, or an
indifference which they felt still less. I had
guessed that, in such scenes, his desire to be
allowed to move about unnoticed, was difficult
to be reduced to perfect practice. But I was
far indeed from being prepared for what I beheld.</p>

<p>Sauntering idly along, I became conscious,
not of a start among the throng&mdash;not of any exclamation&mdash;not
even of any particular hush, but
of an indefinable <i>sensation</i> around me. Crowds
have their general physiognomies like individuals.
This sensation was as perceptible as a change
of countenance, and as silent. I looked up, and
in the midst of a vacant place, from which every
one had shrunk back, as from a plague-stricken
spot, or a haunted floor, or a "fairy-ring," about
ten yards onward and facing me, I saw the emperor
(his head bare), standing alone, with his
back against the opposite wall. I had often seen
him before in the streets, but never with so good
an opportunity of noting his physiognomy, deportment,
figure, and whole appearance.</p>

<p>"Now," said I to myself, "let me realize this
with accuracy. It is not so much the Sovereign
of Russia whom you see there, as it is Russia
itself&mdash;a power&mdash;a sway, in a single person. He
is the only surviving instance or ensample of
types, such as loomed before the minds of the
prophets of God aforetime, and have been thought
worthy to be the themes of their awful predictions.
This is Cyrus, or the second C&aelig;sar; this
a mystic statue&mdash;not that of which the head
was of fine gold, but the breast and the arms of
silver, and the belly and the thighs of brass, and
the legs of iron; the feet part of iron, and part
of clay."</p>

<p>Not such; yet assuredly such like.</p>

<p>I forgot every thing around me, except that
great mighty figure towering aloft. It were useless
to describe very particularly the present Emperor
"of all the Russias." People in England
still remember him, as he was when he visited
us in his magnificent youth. Years have indeed
made some change. His hair is thin, which was
then so abundant. Public care has written some
lines on a face, far more commanding, though
perhaps less haughty, and certainly less blooming
than in those days. But he has still the
same marvelous width of chest and shoulder, the
same royal-looking height, the same large open
blue eye, full of authority and instinct with mind;
a forehead which is even broader and loftier than
of old, and which never yet belonged to one whose
mental powers were not extraordinary; and that
statuesque set of the head, which, if it wore no
crown, would yet make you know it for the head
of some mighty king.</p>

<p>"They would have proclaimed him," said I to
myself, "on their shields, in the days of Attila,
or of Clovis."</p>

<p>On the present occasion, the emperor was
standing alone, as I have said; his back resting
against the wall, and a crowd of the most persistent
gazers around. He looked vexed&mdash;even
melancholy. They would not grant him this
casual moment of amusement untormented. He
had the air of one at bay. He faced the crowd<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_830" id="Page_830">[Pg 830]</a></span>
full, and wherever his glance fell, I could see all
eyes sink before it immediately. It rested a moment
on myself. I had often heard, and often
read, that it was difficult to return his look; and
why I know not. It is but an eye; yet, whether
it was the involuntary sympathy I felt for a king
thus bayed in his moments of relaxation, or
whether it was that in his piercing glance, there
is an expression as if he were about to address
you, and thus to make you the object of universal
notice, or whatever else it may be, I too dropped
my looks to the ground.</p>

<p>A couple of masks approached him as if to
speak; he turned full upon them, to give the
opportunity; their hearts failed them at once,
and with a low courtesy, they shrank back again.</p>

<p>I saw him again several times during the evening,
once walking with a lady (deeply masked,
if I remember). His dress was that of a general
officer, and he wore a lofty hussar's cap, with a
single tall feather at its side. It made his stature
seem still more colossal.</p>

<p>As I was defiling through the crowd, I felt
shortly afterward a sharp blow on my elbow.
Turning, I saw a mask, who, looking at me for
a moment, retreated. I followed till my guide
had sat down in a place where there was room
for two, making me to understand that I was to
occupy the vacant spot. I considered her figure
for a moment, and then feeling perfectly sure
that it was not that of an acquaintance, I declined.
Without any answer, I strolled my way. Having
seen what a masquerade was at the "<i>Nobles'
Hall</i>," I soon afterward left the rooms altogether,
hoping sincerely that the proceeds might be ample,
for the sake of the veteran invalids; and
meditating much on the Czar, whom I had had so
good an opportunity of seeing, and whom these
veterans regarded as by right divine their perpetual
"Generalissimo."</p>

<h2>A SLEEP TO STARTLE US.<br />

<small>BY CHARLES DICKENS.</small></h2>


<p>At the top of Farringdon-street in the city of
London, once adorned by the Fleet Prison,
and by a diabolical jumble of nuisances in the
middle of the road called Fleet Market, is a broad
new thoroughfare in a state of transition. A few
years hence, and we of the present generation
will find it not an easy task to recall, in the
thriving street which will arise upon this spot,
the wooden barriers and hoardings&mdash;the passages
that lead to nothing&mdash;the glimpses of obscene
Field-lane and Saffron-hill&mdash;the mounds
of earth, old bricks, and oyster-shells&mdash;the arched
foundations of unbuilt houses&mdash;the backs of
miserable tenements with patched windows&mdash;the
odds and ends of fever-stricken courts and
alleys&mdash;which are the present features of the
place. Not less perplexing do I find it now, to
reckon how many years have passed since I traversed
these by-ways one night before they were
laid bare, to find out the first Ragged School.</p>

<p>If I say it is ten years ago, I leave a handsome
margin. The discovery was then newly made,
that to talk soundingly in parliament, and cheer
for Church and State, or to consecrate and confirm
without end, or to perorate to any extent in
a thousand market-places about all the ordinary
topics of patriotic songs and sentiments, was
merely to embellish England on a great scale
with whited sepulchres, while there was, in every
corner of the land where its people were closely
accumulated, profound ignorance and perfect
barbarism. It was also newly discovered, that
out of these noxious sinks where they were born
to perish, and where the general ruin was hatching
day and night, the people <i>would not come</i> to
be improved. The gulf between them and all
wholesome humanity had swollen to such a
depth and breadth, that they were separated from
it as by impassable seas or deserts; and so they
lived, and so they died: an always-increasing
band of outlaws in body and soul, against whom
it were to suppose the reversal of all laws, human
and divine, to believe that society could at
last prevail.</p>

<p>In this condition of things, a few unaccredited
messengers of Christianity, whom no bishop had
ever heard of, and no government-office porter
had ever seen, resolved to go to the miserable
wretches who had lost the way to them; and to
set up places of instruction in their own degraded
haunts. I found my first Ragged School, in
an obscure place called West-street, Saffron-hill,
pitifully struggling for life, under every disadvantage.
It had no means, it had no suitable
rooms, it derived no power or protection from being
recognized by any authority, it attracted within
its wretched walls a fluctuating swarm of faces&mdash;young
in years but youthful in nothing else&mdash;that
scowled Hope out of countenance. It was
held in a low-roofed den, in a sickening atmosphere,
in the midst of taint, and dirt, and pestilence:
with all the deadly sins let loose, howling
and shrieking at the doors. Zeal did not
supply the place of method and training; the
teachers knew little of their office; the pupils,
with an evil sharpness, found them out, got the
better of them, derided them, made blasphemous
answers to scriptural questions, sang, fought,
danced, robbed each other; seemed possessed by
legions of devils. The place was stormed and
carried, over and over again; the lights were
blown out, the books strewn in the gutters, and
the female scholars carried off triumphantly to
their old wickedness. With no strength in it
but its purpose, the school stood it all out and
made its way. Some two years since, I found
it, one of many such, in a large, convenient loft
in this transition part of Farringdon-street&mdash;quiet
and orderly, full, lighted with gas, well white-washed,
numerously attended, and thoroughly
established.</p>

<p>The number of houseless creatures who resorted
to it, and who were necessarily turned out
when it closed, to hide where they could in heaps
of moral and physical pollution, filled the managers
with pity. To relieve some of the more
constant and deserving scholars, they rented a
wretched house, where a few common beds&mdash;a
dozen or a dozen-and-a-half perhaps&mdash;were made<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_831" id="Page_831">[Pg 831]</a></span>
upon the floors. This was the Ragged School
Dormitory; and when I found the school in
Farringdon-street, I found the dormitory in a
court hard by, which in the time of the cholera
had acquired a dismal fame. The dormitory was,
in all respects, save as a small beginning, a very
discouraging institution. The air was bad; the
dark and ruinous building, with its small close
rooms, was quite unsuited to the purpose; and
a general supervision of the scattered sleepers
was impossible. I had great doubts at the time
whether, excepting that they found a crazy shelter
for their heads, they were better than in the
streets.</p>

<p>Having heard, in the course of last month,
that this dormitory (there are others elsewhere)
had grown as the school had grown, I went the
other night to make another visit to it. I found
the school in the same place, still advancing. It
was now an Industrial School too; and besides
the men and boys who were learning&mdash;some,
aptly enough; some, with painful difficulty;
some, sluggishly and wearily; some, not at all&mdash;to
read, and write, and cipher; there were
two groups, one of shoemakers, and one (in a
gallery) of tailors, working with great industry
and satisfaction, Each was taught and superintended
by a regular workman engaged for the
purpose, who delivered out the necessary means
and implements. All were employed in mending,
either their own dilapidated clothes or shoes,
or the dilapidated clothes or shoes of some of the
other pupils. They were of all ages, from young
boys to old men. They were quiet, and intent
upon their work. Some of them were almost as
unused to it as I should have shown myself to
be if I had tried my hand, but all were deeply
interested and profoundly anxious to do it somehow
or other. They presented a very remarkable
instance of the general desire there is, after
all, even in the vagabond breast, to know something
useful. One shock-headed man, when he
had mended his own scrap of a coat, drew it on
with such an air of satisfaction, and put himself
to so much inconvenience to look at the elbow
he had darned, that I thought a new coat (and
the mind could not imagine a period when that
coat of his was new!) would not have pleased
him better. In the other part of the school,
where each class was partitioned off by screens
adjusted like the boxes in a coffee-room, was
some very good writing, and some singing of the
multiplication-table&mdash;the latter, on a principle
much too juvenile and innocent for some of the
singers. There was also a ciphering-class,
where a young pupil teacher out of the streets,
who refreshed himself by spitting every half-minute,
had written a legible sum in compound
addition, on a broken slate, and was walking
backward and forward before it, as he worked it,
for the instruction of his class, in this way:</p>

<p>Now then! Look here, all on you! Seven
and five, how many?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sharp Boy</span> (in no particular clothes).&mdash;Twelve!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pupil Teacher.</span>&mdash;Twelve&mdash;and eight?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dull Young Man</span> (with water on the brain).&mdash;Forty-five!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sharp Boy.</span>&mdash;Twenty!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pupil Teacher.</span>&mdash;Twenty. You're right.
And nine?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dull Young Man</span> (after great consideration).&mdash;Twenty-nine!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pupil Teacher.</span>&mdash;Twenty-nine it is. And nine!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Reckless Guesser.</span>&mdash;Seventy-four!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pupil Teacher</span> (drawing nine strokes).&mdash;How
can that be? Here's nine on 'em! Look!
Twenty-nine, and one's thirty, and one's thirty-one,
and one's thirty-two, and one's thirty-three,
and one's thirty-four, and one's thirty-five, and
one's thirty-six, and one's thirty-seven, and one's
what?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Reckless Guesser.</span>&mdash;Four-and-two-pence
farden!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dull Young Man</span> (who had been absorbed in
the demonstration).&mdash;Thirty-eight!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pupil Teacher</span> (restraining sharp boy's ardor).&mdash;Of
course it is! Thirty-eight pence.
There they are! (writing 38 in slate-corner.)
Now what do you make of thirty-eight pence?
Thirty-eight pence, how much? (Dull young
man slowly considers and gives it up, under a
week.) How much, you? (to sleepy boy, who
stares and says nothing.) How much, <i>you</i>?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sharp Boy.</span>&mdash;Three-and-twopence!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pupil Teacher.</span>&mdash;Three-and-twopence. How
do I put down three-and-twopence?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sharp Boy.</span>&mdash;You puts down the two, and
you carries the three.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pupil Teacher.</span>&mdash;Very good. Where do I
carry the three?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Reckless Guesser.</span>&mdash;T'other side the slate!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sharp Boy.</span>&mdash;You carries him to the next
column on the left hand, and adds him on!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pupil Teacher.</span>&mdash;And adds him on! and
eight and three's eleven, and eight's nineteen,
and seven's what?</p>

<p>&mdash;And so on.</p>

<p>The best and most spirited teacher was a
young man, himself reclaimed through the agency
of this school from the lowest depths of misery
and debasement, whom the committee were about
to send out to Australia. He appeared quite to
deserve the interest they took in him, and his
appearance and manner were a strong testimony
to the merits of the establishment.</p>

<p>All this was not the dormitory, but it was the
preparation for it. No man or boy is admitted
to the dormitory, unless he is a regular attendant
at the school, and unless he has been in the
school two hours before the time of opening the
dormitory. If there be reason to suppose that
he can get any work to do and will not do it, he
is admitted no more, and his place is assigned to
some other candidate for the nightly refuge: of
whom there are always plenty. There is very
little to tempt the idle and profligate. A scanty
supper and a scanty breakfast, each of six ounces
of bread and nothing else (this quantity is less
than the present penny-loaf), would scarcely be
regarded by Mr. Chadwick himself as a festive
or uproarious entertainment.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_832" id="Page_832">[Pg 832]</a></span>
I found the Dormitory below the School: with
its bare walls and rafters, and bare floor, the
building looked rather like an extensive coach-house,
well lighted with gas. A wooden gallery
had been recently erected on three sides of it;
and, abutting from the centre of the wall on the
fourth side, was a kind of glazed meat-safe, accessible
by a ladder; in which the presiding
officer is posted every night, and all night. In
the centre of the room, which was very cool, and
perfectly sweet, stood a small fixed stove; on
two sides, there were windows; on all sides,
simple means of admitting fresh air, and releasing
foul air. The ventilation of the place, devised
by <span class="smcap">Doctor Arnott</span>, and particularly the
expedient for relieving the sleepers in the galleries
from receiving the breath of the sleepers below,
is a wonder of simplicity, cheapness, efficiency,
and practical good sense. If it had cost
five or ten thousand pounds, it would have been
famous.</p>

<p>The whole floor of the building, with the exception
of a few narrow pathways, was partitioned
off into wooden troughs, or shallow boxes
without lids&mdash;not unlike the fittings in the shop
of a dealer in corn and flour, and seeds. The
galleries were parceled out in this same way.
Some of these berths were very short&mdash;for boys;
some, longer&mdash;for men. The largest were of
very contracted limits; all were composed of the
bare boards; each was furnished only with one
coarse rug, rolled up. In the brick pathways
were iron gratings communicating with trapped
drains, enabling the entire surface of these sleeping-places
to be soused and flooded with water
every morning. The floor of the galleries was
cased with zinc, and fitted with gutters and
escape-pipes, for the same reason. A supply of
water, both for drinking and for washing, and
some tin vessels for either purpose, were at hand.
A little shed, used by one of the industrial classes,
for the chopping up of fire-wood, did not occupy the
whole of the spare space in that corner; and the
remainder was devoted to some excellent baths,
available also as washing troughs, in order that
those who have any rags of linen may clean them
once a week. In aid of this object, a drying-closet,
charged with hot-air, was about to be
erected in the wood-chopping shed. All these
appliances were constructed in the simplest
manner, with the commonest means, in the narrowest
space, at the lowest cost; but were perfectly
adapted to their respective purposes.</p>

<p>I had scarcely made the round of the Dormitory,
and looked at all these things, when a
moving of feet overhead announced that the
School was breaking up for the night. It was
succeeded by profound silence, and then by a
hymn, sung in a subdued tone, and in very good
time and tune, by the learners we had lately
seen. Separated from their miserable bodies,
the effect of their voices, united in this strain,
was infinitely solemn. It was as if their souls
were singing&mdash;as if the outward differences that
parted us had fallen away, and the time was
come when all the perverted good that was in
them, or that ever might have been in them,
arose imploringly to Heaven.</p>

<p>The baker who had brought the bread, and
who leaned against a pillar while the singing
was in progress, meditating in his way, whatever
his way was, now shouldered his basket
and retired. The two half-starved attendants
(rewarded with a double portion for their pains)
heaped the six-ounce loaves into other baskets,
and made ready to distribute them. The night-officer
arrived, mounted to his meat-safe, unlocked
it, hung up his hat, and prepared to spend
the evening. I found him to be a very respectable-looking
person in black, with a wife and
family; engaged in an office all day, and passing
his spare time here, from half-past nine every
night to six every morning, for a pound a week.
He had carried the post against two hundred
competitors.</p>

<p>The door was now opened, and the men and
boys who were to pass that night in the Dormitory,
in number one hundred and sixty-seven
(including a man for whom there was no trough,
but who was allowed to rest in the seat by the
stove, once occupied by the night-officer before
the meat-safe was), came in. They passed to
their different sleeping-places, quietly and in
good order. Every one sat down in his own crib,
where he became presented in a curiously fore-shortened
manner; and those who had shoes
took them off, and placed them in the adjoining
path. There were, in the assembly, thieves,
cadgers, trampers, vagrants, common outcasts
of all sorts. In casual wards and many other
Refuges, they would have been very difficult to
deal with; but they were restrained here by the
law of kindness, and had long since arrived at
the knowledge that those who gave them that
shelter could have no possible inducement save
to do them good. Neighbors spoke little together&mdash;they
were almost as uncompanionable
as mad people&mdash;but every body took his small
loaf when the baskets went round, with a thankfulness
more or less cheerful, and immediately
ate it up.</p>

<p>There was some excitement in consequence
of one man being missing; "the lame old man."
Every body had seen the lame old man up-stairs
asleep, but he had unaccountably disappeared.
What he had been doing with himself was a
mystery, but, when the inquiry was at its height,
he came shuffling and tumbling in, with his
palsied head hanging on his breast&mdash;an emaciated
drunkard, once a compositor, dying of starvation
and decay. He was so near death, that he could
not be kept there, lest he should die in the night;
and, while it was under deliberation what to do
with him, and while his dull lips tried to shape
out answers to what was said to him, he was
held up by two men. Beside this wreck, but all
unconnected with it and with the whole world,
was an orphan boy with burning cheeks and
great gaunt eager eyes, who was in pressing
peril of death too, and who had no possession
under the broad sky but a bottle of physic and a
scrap of writing. He brought both from the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_833" id="Page_833">[Pg 833]</a></span>
house-surgeon of a Hospital that was too full to
admit him, and stood, giddily staggering in one
of the little pathways, while the Chief Samaritan
read, in hasty characters underlined, how momentous
his necessities were. He held the bottle
of physic in his claw of a hand, and stood,
apparently unconscious of it, staggering, and
staring with his bright glazed eyes; a creature,
surely, as forlorn and desolate as Mother Earth
can have supported on her breast that night. He
was gently taken away, along with the dying
man, to the workhouse; and he passed into the
darkness with his physic-bottle as if he were
going into his grave.</p>

<p>The bread eaten to the last crumb; and some
drinking of water and washing in water having
taken place, with very little stir or noise indeed;
preparations were made for passing the night.
Some, took off their rags of smock frocks; some,
their rags of coats or jackets, and spread them
out within their narrow bounds for beds; designing
to lie upon them, and use their rugs as a
covering. Some, sat up, pondering, on the
edges of their troughs; others, who were very
tired, rested their unkempt heads upon their
hands and their elbows on their knees, and
dozed. When there were no more who desired
to drink or wash, and all were in their places,
the night officer, standing below the meat-safe,
read a short evening service, including perhaps as
inappropriate a prayer as could possibly be read
(as though the Lord's Prayer stood in need of it by
way of Rider), and a portion of a chapter from the
New Testament. Then, they all sang the Evening
Hymn, and then they all lay down to sleep.</p>

<p>It was an awful thing, looking round upon
those one hundred and sixty-seven representatives
of many thousands, to reflect that a Government,
unable, with the least regard to truth, to
plead ignorance of the existence of such a place,
should proceed as if the sleepers never were to
wake again. I do not hesitate to say&mdash;why
should I, for I know it to be true!&mdash;that an
annual sum of money, contemptible in amount
as compared with any charges upon any list,
freely granted in behalf of these Schools, and
shackled with no preposterous Red Tape conditions,
would relieve the prisons, diminish county
rates, clear loads of shame and guilt out of the
streets, recruit the army and navy, waft to new
countries fleets full of useful labor, for which
their inhabitants would be thankful and beholden
to us. It is no depreciation of the devoted people
whom I found presiding here, to add, that
with such assistance as a trained knowledge of the
business of instruction, and a sound system
adjusted to the peculiar difficulties and conditions
of this sphere of action, their usefulness
could be increased fifty-fold in a few months.</p>

<p>My Lords and Gentlemen, can you, at the present
time, consider this at last, and agree to do
some little easy thing! Dearly beloved brethren
elsewhere, do you know that between Gorham
controversies, and Pusey controversies, and Newman
controversies, and twenty other edifying
controversies, a certain large class of minds in
the community is gradually being driven out of
all religion? Would it be well, do you think, to
come out of the controversies for a little while,
and be simply Apostolic thus low down?</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2>LOUIS NAPOLEON AND HIS NOSE.</h2>


<p>The following passage from a letter is amusing,
as well as instructive:</p>

<p>"Trifles are said to amuse weak minds, and
probably by a similar process of reasoning, they
may be said to annoy great minds. The extreme
susceptibility of the President respecting any attempt
to turn either his person or policy into
ridicule has been frequently noticed, and this excessive
susceptibility has gradually attained an
intensity which gives it the air of absolute monomania.
The police have peremptory orders to
ravage any shop in which any work or engraving
is to be found in any way reflecting upon that
prominent feature in the Presidental visage which
has secured for him the time-honored title of
'<i>Noscitur a naso</i>.' Any semblance of a caricature
on the Presidental proboscis exposes the
unfortunate possessor (as George Robins would
have said) to the persecution of the police. A
short time past Paris was inundated with a ludicrous
counterfeit portrait of the President's features,
which were fashioned into a crockery tobacco-pot.
The resemblance was so striking,
and yet so irresistibly ludicrous withal&mdash;for you
know there is but one step from the sublime to
the ridiculous&mdash;that these tobacco-pots were
eagerly purchased, and the designer made a
small fortune in his way. The police have of
late busily occupied themselves in hunting out
the purchasers of these crockery caricatures,
which are seized and broken without mitigation
or remorse. The crockery shops have been ransacked,
and whenever any have been found the
shopkeepers have been exposed to considerable
annoyance and persecution. Some weeks since
two girls were condemned to fine and imprisonment
for having openly declared that they never
could fall in love with Louis Napoleon. But the
Prince now appears disposed to carry the matter
still further; for it is alleged that rather sharp
notes have been sent to Belgium by the Minister
of Foreign Affairs with respect to a masquerade
which took place at Ghent in the latter part of
the Carnival. Some young men, it appears,
promenaded through the streets, a man on a
horse, wearing a dress to represent the President
of the Republic, and with a gigantic false nose.
This man carried in his hand a whip with which
he struck from time to time a set of puppets
which he carried in his hand&mdash;the puppets, each
of which had a lock on his mouth, being intended
to represent the French Senators and Deputies.
The Belgian government is said to have replied
that it disapproved of the parody, and offered to
dismiss the commissary of police who did not fulfill
his duty by preventing it. But the French
government not considering this satisfaction sufficient,
requires, it is said, the dismissal of the
governor, who was on the balcony when the
masquerade passed."</p>

<h2>Monthly Record of Current Events.</h2>


<h3>THE UNITED STATES.</h3>

<p>In Congress, during the past month, debate has
turned mainly on topics connected with the approaching
Presidential contest. In the Senate, the
resolutions upon the subject of non-intervention
have been still further discussed, but no vote has
been taken upon them. On the 18th of March, Senator
Jones, of Tennessee, replied at length to the
speeches of Senators Cass and Seward upon this
subject&mdash;seeking to establish, by copious citation of
authorities, that it had never been the policy of this
country to take any part whatever in the affairs of
other nations, and urging the importance of still adhering
to this course. He was opposed to protesting
against the violation of international law by Russia,
unless we were prepared to enforce that protest by
war. Senator Cass rejoined, defending his positions
from the assault of Senator Jones. On the 22d, Senator
Soul&eacute;, of Louisiana, spoke upon the subject.
Whatever might be the fate of the resolutions, he
said, their discussion had given the country a chance
of expressing its sympathy with the oppressed and
down-trodden nations of the earth. He then entered
upon a historical argument of some length to show
that the neutrality advocated and enforced by Washington,
during the war between England and France,
was simply a matter of necessity&mdash;a temporary measure,
which the exigencies of the time demanded;
and that it was not regarded by Washington as a permanent
rule for the action of this country. And further,
even if this were not so, and if Washington
had really set forth the doctrine, that this country
must always remain indifferent to the movements of
other nations, Senator Soul&eacute; urged, our national
growth and progress would render it obsolete. The
policy of this nation could not remain the same from
century to century; it must change with changing
circumstances, and keep pace with the rapid increase
of our national population and power. Upon
the conclusion of his remarks, the subject was again
postponed. On the 26th, a message from the President
announced that certain papers, connected with
the prosecution of Mexican claims, which had been
placed on file in the State Department, had been
abstracted therefrom; and asking for the adoption
of measures for the better protection of public
documents and papers. On the 19th, Senator Cass
made a statement of his views on the Wilmot Proviso,
in reply to some remarks in a published letter
from Senator Davis, of Mississippi. He denied
the right of Congress to impose upon a territorial
government any restriction in regard to its
legislation upon slavery, claiming for the Legislature
the right to establish or prohibit slavery, as
it may see fit. He also justified the first settlers
of California in the steps they took for the establishment
of a government, and complained that
many gentlemen at the South did not make a just
and proper allowance for the sentiments of the
North concerning slavery. In the <i>House of Representatives</i>,
the proceedings have been wholly unimportant.
A bill to supply deficiencies in the appropriations
for the last fiscal year, has been made the
occasion for discussing the prospects of political
parties, and the relative claims of various candidates
for the Presidency. On the 10th of March, Mr. Richardson,
of Illinois, spoke in defense of Senator
Douglass, from imputations made upon his political
course; and Mr. Breckenridge, of Kentucky, vindicated
General Butler from similar censure. On
the 18th, Mr. Marshall, of Kentucky, defended President
Fillmore against various assailants, and the
discussion was pursued from day to day.</p>

<p>Political Conventions have been held in several
States during the month. In Louisiana, the Whigs
held one at Baton Rouge on the 16th of March, at
which resolutions were adopted in favor of nominating
Mr. Fillmore for President, and Mr. Crittenden
for Vice-President&mdash;declaring the unabated devotion
of the people of the State to the Union&mdash;demanding
the protection of Government for the commerce, agriculture,
and manufactures of the country&mdash;affirming
the mission of this Republic to be, "not to propagate
our opinions, or impose on other countries our form
of government, by artifice or force, but to teach by
example, and show by our success, moderation, and
justice, the blessings of self-government, and the
advantages of free institutions;"&mdash;sustaining the
Compromise measures, and pledging the Whigs of
the State to support the nominee of the National
Convention. The Democratic State Convention declared
its preference for General Cass, as the Presidential
candidate, by a vote of 101, to 72 for Judge
Douglass.&mdash;&mdash;In Virginia, a Democratic Convention
assembled at Richmond on the 24th of March: a good
deal of difficulty was experienced in effecting an organization.
On the third day of the session, resolutions
were adopted, affirming the resolutions of
1798-9; denouncing a protective tariff and a division
of the public lands among the States; and re-affirming
the Baltimore platform. They also resolved to
appoint four delegates from each Congressional District
to the Baltimore National Convention, who
shall in that body sustain the two-thirds rule, and be
untrammeled in their choice of a candidate for the
Presidency, but vote for such a one as can command
the greatest strength with the Democracy, and whose
principles are known to conform most strictly to the
cardinal tenets of the Democratic faith.&mdash;&mdash;In Pennsylvania,
a Whig State Convention met at Harrisburgh,
on the 24th. Resolutions were adopted, expressing
a desire to act in harmony with the Whig
party throughout the Union, declaring in favor of a
protective tariff, proclaiming devotion to the Constitution
and the Union, commending the administration
of President Fillmore, and nominating General
Scott unanimously as the Whig candidate for the
Presidency. A resolution was also adopted, expressing
regret at the illness of Mr. Clay.&mdash;&mdash;The Legislature
of Mississippi adjourned on the 16th of March.
No United States Senator was chosen for the full
term, to commence at the close of the present Congress.
In both Houses a bill was rejected which
proposed to provide for the payment of the bonds of
the State issued on account of the Planters' Bank,
but both Houses passed a bill, which has become a
law, submitting the question of their payment to a
vote of the people. The bill for districting the State,
for the election of five members of Congress, was
lost, from disagreement between the two Houses&mdash;both
being willing to pass the bill, but they could not
agree as to the composition of the districts.&mdash;&mdash;In
Alabama, a Southern Rights State Convention met
on the 4th. Only a small portion of the State was
represented. Resolutions were adopted in favor of
maintaining the separate organization of the Southern
Rights party, but acquiescing in the decision of
the Southern States against secession for the present.&mdash;&mdash;A
message from Governor Bigler, of Pennsylvania,
in regard to the debt of that State, states<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_835" id="Page_835">[Pg 835]</a></span>
that there is now due and unpaid two millions four
hundred and ninety-one thousand two hundred and
fifty-five dollars of the bonds of the Commonwealth,
bearing an interest of six per cent., and a balance of
near one hundred thousand dollars due to domestic
creditors, bearing a like interest, besides one million
three hundred and ninety thousand dollars, at five
per cent.; over two millions will fall due in 1853,
and about three millions in 1854. He recommends
that the matured bonds, and such as may fall due
during the year, be canceled by the negotiation of a
loan, and that bonds of the Commonwealth be issued,
reimbursable at the expiration of ten or fifteen years,
at a rate of interest not exceeding five per cent., with
interest certificates attached, or in the usual form,
as may be deemed proper.</p>

<p>Mr. Webster happening to visit Trenton, N.J., to
take part in a legal argument, was received by the
Legislature of the State, on the 26th of March. He
was welcomed in a highly eulogistic speech, to which
he replied briefly, paying a high compliment to the
gallant devotion of New Jersey to the cause of the
country during the Revolution, and expressing his
thanks for the distinguished attentions which had
been shown to him. Senator Stockton, who happened
to be present, spoke in terms of high admiration
of Mr. Webster, commending his political course,
and alluding incidentally to various topics of public
interest.&mdash;&mdash;Hon. <span class="smcap">Jeremiah Morrow</span>, a distinguished
citizen of Ohio, died on the 25th of March, at the
advanced age of 73. He was a member of the Territorial
Legislature of Ohio in 1800, a member of the
Convention to form a State Constitution in 1802, the
first member of Congress from that State, afterward
Senator and then Governor, serving in the latter capacity
two terms, and then returning to Congress.
He was a man of ability, influence, and marked integrity.&mdash;&mdash;A
serious accident happened in the East
River, near New York, on the 26th of March. M.
Maillefert, a French scientific gentleman, had been
for some time engaged in blasting under water the
rocks forming the whirlpool known as Hell-gate, by
lowering upon the rock very heavy charges of powder,
and exploding them by a galvanic battery. On
this occasion, through some misunderstanding, the
wrong wire was put into his hands, and he exploded
a canister lying in a boat and containing sixty or
seventy pounds of gunpowder. Three men were
killed, and two or three others, including M. Maillefert
himself, were seriously injured.&mdash;&mdash;Ninety of
the Americans, captured in Cuba and released by
the Queen of Spain, reached New York on the 13th
of March.&mdash;&mdash;An extract of a private letter from Mr.
Clay has been published, in which he declares his
preference for Mr. Fillmore as the Whig candidate
for the Presidency, on the ground that he has administered
the executive government with signal success
and ability. Either Gen. Scott or Mr. Webster, he
says, "might possibly administer the government as
well as Mr. Fillmore has done. But neither of them
has been tried." Mr. Fillmore has been tried, and Mr.
Clay thinks that "prudence and wisdom should restrain
us from making any change without necessity."&mdash;&mdash;Seven
vessels of war are fitting out at New
York to join the squadron in the East India seas.
It is stated that in connection with other duties,
Commodore Perry, the commander of this squadron,
is to be instructed to make commercial arrangements
with Japan, and for the better treatment of shipwrecked
American sailors, who have been heretofore
barbarously treated by the Japanese in several instances;
and possibly may be required to make reclamations
for injuries and losses heretofore sustained
by American citizens. Japan has now no
treaty with any Christian government except Holland.</p>

<p>From <span class="smcap">California</span> we have intelligence to the 1st
of March. The steamship North America running
from Panama to San Francisco, went ashore on the
28th of February, about seventy miles south of Acapulco.
The vessel is a total loss; she had over 750
passengers, all of whom were saved.&mdash;&mdash;Both political
parties in California had chosen delegates to the
National Conventions. No further injury had been
sustained from attacks of the Indians, and in the
southern part of the State every thing was quiet.
Mr. Bartlett, of the Boundary Commission, had
reached San Francisco, after a very severe journey
across the desert. A bill was pending in the Legislature
authorizing the call of a State Convention to
revise the Constitution, and the project of dividing
the State continued also to be pressed. Crime
had increased considerably in San Francisco, and
the Vigilance Committee had again been organized.
The anniversary of Washington's birthday was celebrated
at that city with great spirit. Col. Berzenczey,
who came to the United States in Kossuth's
suite had arrived at San Francisco on his way to
Chinese Tartary, which he intends to explore in
order to discover, if possible, the origin of the Magyar
race: it has been stated that a tribe of Magyars
still exists in some part of that vast and unknown
region. The United States sloop of war St. Mary's
had reached San Francisco, under orders to take on
board and return to their homes a number of shipwrecked
Japanese. From the mines the news is
not important. Owing to lack of rain the labors of
the miners had been less productive than usual.
Rich quartz veins continue to be found, and very
extensive preparations are being made for working
them. The whole amount of gold exported from
San Francisco during the year ending December 31,
1851, was $34,492,633. Judge Tefft, with three
other persons, was drowned, while attempting to
land from the Ohio at San Luis Obispo, in a small
boat&mdash;the surf being high.</p>


<h3>MEXICO.</h3>

<p>We have news from the City of Mexico to the
28th of February. Both Houses of Congress had
voted the suppression of the justices of the peace,
but the Government had refused its sanction to the
act. It is stated that claims to the amount of twenty
or thirty millions of dollars will be brought against
the United States, under the treaty of Guadalupe
Hidalgo, for outrages committed by Indians and invaders
on the frontier. The administration of Gen.
Arista is losing strength, and rumors were current
of new plans of revolution of which Santa Anna is
at the head.</p>

<p>Intelligence from the Rio Grande fully confirms
the defeat of Caravajal and the suppression of the
insurrectionary movement in that quarter. On the
21st of February that chief led his forces, consisting
of about 300 men to the attack on Camargo, when
he was met by about 250 Mexican cavalry. The
latter charged upon him three times, when the force
under his command broke in confusion and fled across
the river. His loss is stated at between thirty and
sixty. This ends the revolutionary attempt in Northern
Mexico.&mdash;&mdash;Serious annoyance is experienced
from the ravages of the Indians in that quarter. On
the evening of the 21st a party of sixteen attacked
a party of Americans and Mexicans near San Antonio,
and killed several of the latter. About two
hundred of them were encamped at Lake Espantoza,
near the junction of the Leona and Nueces rivers.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_836" id="Page_836">[Pg 836]</a></span>
On the 16th, a party of dragoons attacked a body of
Indians near Belleville, and dispersed them after
killing four.</p>


<h3>SOUTH AMERICA.</h3>

<p>We have at length reliable news of decisive events
on the Rio de la Plata. Rosas has been routed by
Urquiza, and has fled to England. The control of
the whole country, therefore, passes into new hands.
From Buenos Ayres our intelligence is to the 3d of
February. The passage of the Parana by the liberating
army under Gen. Urquiza, commenced on
the 22d of December, and was accomplished on the
8th of January. His force consisting of 28,000 men,
with 50,000 horses, and 50 pieces of artillery, was
brought together on the Diamant&eacute;, one of the strongest
points upon the river, and he was at once joined
by the citizens of the whole province of Santa F&eacute;,
and by 4000 troops of Rosas. The Governor of the
Province fled toward Buenos Ayres. On the 10th
of January the inhabitants of San Nicolao, the frontier
town of the province of Buenos Ayres, pronounced
against Rosas, and repelled an attack made
upon them by a large cavalry force stationed near them.
On the 15th Gen. Urquiza passed the frontier, with his
whole army; and in a march of twelve days obtained
possession of the entire northern part of the province,
driving out all the cavalry of Rosas, which had been
detached for its defense. On the 29th of January,
his advanced guard reached the Rio Conchas, within
six leagues of Buenos Ayres, having forced General
Pacheco to retreat across that river with the small
force remaining of those with whom he had gone to
the defense of the province. Rosas had divided his
force into three parts&mdash;one division of 4000 under
Echaqu&eacute;, another of 3500 under Mancilla, and the
third of 5800 under Pacheco. This disposition of
them rendered it easy for Urquiza to attack and defeat
them separately. On the 27th of January Rosas
set out for Santos Lugares, where his main force had
been collected. A general engagement at once took
place along the whole line of defense, which lasted
for several hours, and resulted in the total defeat of
the forces of Rosas, General Urquiza remaining master
of the field. Rosas immediately fled on board a
British vessel in the harbor of Buenos Ayres, with
the intention of proceeding to England at the earliest
opportunity. He had been engaged for some weeks
in securing large amounts of treasure, in apparent
preparation for such a flight. General Urquiza immediately
followed up his victory by investing the
city of Buenos Ayres. Deprived of its governor, of
course it could make no long defense, and steps had
already been taken to organize a constitutional government
under the new auspices. The intelligence
of the fall of Rosas had created the liveliest satisfaction
in England, and was followed by an immediate
and very considerable rise in the market value of
Buenos Ayres bonds. This change in the political
prospects of that portion of South America, it is believed,
will lead to a largely increased emigration
thither from the southern parts of Europe. The government
of Rosas has been for many years an object
of terror and distrust in Buenos Ayres, and has greatly
retarded the industry and progress of the country.
It has at last been overthrown&mdash;not by the intervention
of foreign states, but by the independent exertions
of the people themselves. General Urquiza, the
successful soldier, seems disposed to use his power
so as to promote the best interests of the country, and
under his guidance a new organization of the several
states may be expected.&mdash;&mdash;The Congress of <i>Venezuela</i>
was still in session on the 10th of March. The
affairs of the country were highly prosperous.&mdash;&mdash;The
revolted convicts at the Straits of Magellan had been
seized by the British war steamer Virago, and taken
heavily ironed to Valparaiso. There were in all 350,
of whom 180 were taken from the British brig Eliza
Cornish, which they had seized:&mdash;the rest had taken
the American bark Florida, but were afterward subdued
by a counter-plot on board, and were delivered
up. The officers of the Cornish had been shot in
cold blood by the miscreants, who were guilty of
shocking barbarities. They were landed at Valparaiso,
February 25, and delivered over to the authorities.&mdash;&mdash;In
<i>Peru</i> an expedition had been organized
by General Flores, against Ecuador. It is said he has
enlisted two or three thousand men, and sent out four
or five vessels loaded with men and munitions, for an
attack on the city of Guayaquil. Great excitement
prevailed at the latter place, where preparations had
been made to give the invaders a warm reception.&mdash;&mdash;Panama
papers record the successful result of
an expedition to the reputed gold placers on the coast
of Choco, in the southern part of the kingdom of <i>New
Grenada</i>, about 150 miles south of Panama. About
1500 ounces of pure gold dust were exhibited in the
latter city, as the first-fruits of the enterprise. There
seems to be no doubt of the existence of the <i>oro</i> in
that vicinity in large quantities.</p>


<h3>GREAT BRITAIN.</h3>

<p>The political intelligence of the month has little
interest. The Derby Ministry still retains office, but
without any definite announcement of the line of policy
it intends to pursue. On the evening of February
27, the Earl of Derby made a statement of the reasons
which had induced him to take office. With
regard to the intentions of the new ministry, he said
he should seek to maintain peace with foreign nations
by calm and conciliatory conduct, and by strict
adherence to the obligations of treaties. He was for
rigidly respecting the right of every nation, great and
small, to govern themselves in their own way. So
far as the national defenses were concerned, he
thought the preparations wisely made by his predecessor
should be continued, so as to screen the country
from the possibility of invasion. As regarded
refugees, while England was the natural refuge of all
political exiles, it was the duty of the latter not to
abuse her hospitality; and the government was bound
to keep watch of them, and warn their governments
of any steps they might take hostile to their peace.
With regard to financial measures, although he avowed
his belief that a revision of the existing system
was desirable, he was aware that it could only be
effected by reference to the clearly expressed wish of
the people. So large a question could only be dealt
with by a government strong in popular confidence,
and not by one called suddenly to office. He did not
know whether he had a majority in that House; he
knew he was in a minority in the other&mdash;but he had
not felt that the public interest would be consulted by
a dissolution at this period of the year and in this condition
of the world. Government would have to appeal
to the forbearance of its adversaries and to the
patience of its supporters, but he had too much confidence
in the good sense of the House of Commons
to believe that it would unnecessarily take up subjects
of controversy while there were legal and social
reforms for which the country was anxious. In reference
to the measures introduced by the late government,
he said that he was most desirous to crush
corruption to the utmost of his power, but that, as
regarded the proposed reform bill, he should not follow
it up, and he warned his hearers, especially
members of the House of Commons, against the danger
of perpetually unsettling everything, and settling<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_837" id="Page_837">[Pg 837]</a></span>
nothing. He did not contend that the system established
in 1831 was perfect, or did not require amendment,
but he wished to be sure that a proposed remedy
would not aggravate the evils complained of. As regarded
education, the feelings of all classes had united
in the conviction that the more you educated the
safer was the country; but he was opposed to the
mere acquisition of secular knowledge, dissociated
from the culture of the soul. And although he looked
on all engaged in education as his fellow-laborers,
his chief reliance would be on the parochial clergy.
This explanation on the part of the new ministry has
not been received as sufficiently explicit to be satisfactory,
and it meets, therefore, with very warm hostility.
Lord John Russell, in announcing his own
retirement, took occasion to say that, for the future,
he should think it his duty to oppose, out of office, as
he had opposed in office, any restoration of the duty
on corn, whether under the name of protection or of
revenue;&mdash;that he should support an extension of the
suffrage to those who are fit to exercise the franchise
for the welfare of the country; and that he should use
the little influence he might possess for the maintenance
of the blessings of peace.&mdash;Parliament, after
these explanations, adjourned until the 12th of March.&mdash;Mr.
Disraeli, the new Chancellor of the Exchequer,
has issued a brief address to his constituents,
stating that on the 12th of March he should ask for a
re-election. The first duty of the new administration,
he said, would be to provide for the ordinary exigencies
of the government; but at no distant period they
hoped to establish a policy in conformity with the
principles which in opposition they had felt it their
duty to maintain. "We shall endeavor," he adds,
"to terminate that strife of classes which of late
years has exercised so pernicious an influence over
the welfare of this kingdom; to accomplish those
remedial measures which great productive interests,
suffering from unequal taxation, have a right to demand
from a just government; to cultivate friendly
relations with all foreign powers, and secure honorable
peace; to uphold in their spirit, as well as in
their form, our political institutions; and to increase
the efficiency, as well as maintain the rights, of our
national and Protestant church." Other members of
the government had issued similar addresses to their
respective constituencies, and several of them had
already been re-elected.&mdash;At a subsequent session,
the ministry intimated that they would no longer resist
the demand of the country for a dissolution.</p>

<p>The advent of the Protective Ministry has called
into new life the Anti-Corn Law League at Manchester.
A meeting of the League was held on the
2d of March, at which resolutions were adopted reorganizing
the association, and taking measures to
urge upon their friends throughout the kingdom, not
to return members in favor of restoring the duties on
corn; it was also resolved to petition the Queen for
an immediate dissolution of Parliament in order that
the question of Free Trade might be decided by a
prompt appeal to the people. Mr. Cobden was present,
and made a long speech vindicating the operation
of the existing system, and resisting the policy of
allowing the Ministry to strengthen themselves for
the restoration of the protective system. He wished
the friends of cheap bread to unite in order to drive
the government into one of three courses&mdash;either to
recant forever the principle of protection, resign their
seats, or dissolve Parliament. It was within their
power to compel one or the other of these steps to
be taken. A very large subscription was immediately
raised to defray the expenses of the projected agitation.</p>

<p>The Earl of Derby, on taking office, tendered to Mr.
Layard a continuance in office as Under Secretary
of State. The offer, however, was declined.&mdash;&mdash;Ireland
lost two of its most celebrated men on the 26th
of February&mdash;<span class="smcap">Thomas Moore</span>, the sweetest and
best of her poets, and Archbishop <span class="smcap">Murray</span>, the
mildest and best of the prelates of the Roman Catholic
Church in that country. Moore was in his 72d
year, the Archbishop in his 83d year. Moore died
at his cottage at Sloperton, near Devizes. For several
years he had been alive only in the body. Like
Sir Walter Scott and Southey, the tenacity of physical
existence outlived the term of the mind. He
was buried, according to his long-ago expressed wish,
in the quiet church-yard of the village where he died.
Sir <span class="smcap">Herbert Jenner Fust</span>, Dean of Arches, and
long connected with law proceedings and law literature,
died on the 20th February, in the 76th year of
his age.</p>


<h3>FRANCE AND CENTRAL EUROPE.</h3>

<p>The elections for members of the Legislative corps
were held throughout France on the 29th of February,
and resulted in the success of the Government candidate
in nearly every instance. Gen. Cavaignac
and Carnot are the only Opposition candidates of
any prominence who have been elected. What
course they will pursue is still a matter of conjecture.
It is clear, however, that such a thing as an
opposition party in the Legislature will scarcely
exist.</p>

<p>The President continues the issue of decrees for
the government of France. They embrace, of course,
the entire scope of legislation, as the country for the
present has no other source of law. One of the most
important of these decrees is that authorizing the
establishment of Mortgage Banks, the object of which
is to enable owners of real estate to borrow on mortgage,
and repay the loans by means of long annuities;
that is, in addition to the interest the borrower is
obliged to pay annually say one per cent. as a sinking
fund, which will extinguish the debt in forty
years. The banks are to loan on double real estate
security. They are allowed to issue notes or bonds.
They are not to require more than five per cent. interest,
nor more than two nor less than one per cent.
as a sinking fund. An article in the <i>Moniteur</i> followed
the publication of this decree for the purpose
of explaining its provisions, from which it appears
that there are $160,000,000 of mortgaged debts in
France, paying, inclusive of various expenses, an
average interest of eight per cent., and that these
debts are increasing at the rate of $12,000,000 yearly.
It is claimed that the new law will remedy this
state of things, and Germany is pointed to in proof
of the beneficial effects of mortgage societies.&mdash;&mdash;Another
financial decree directs that the holders of
five per cent. government funds will receive hereafter
only four and a half per cent. or the principal at par
value, at their option. The effect of this change will
be to reduce the annual interest on the national debt,
by about three and a half millions of dollars. The
holders of these securities of course complain of it
as an unjust reduction of their incomes.&mdash;&mdash;Another
decree directs the entire organization of the College
of France to be put under the immediate control of
the President, until the law for its permanent establishment
shall have been prepared. New officers
have been appointed throughout&mdash;a number of the
most distinguished scholars of France being superseded.&mdash;&mdash;It
has also been decreed that judicial officers
shall be disqualified at seventy years of age.
By this means the President secures the displacement
of a large number of judges, whose seats he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_838" id="Page_838">[Pg 838]</a></span>
will fill with persons more acceptable to himself.&mdash;&mdash;It
is decided that M. Billault is to be President
of the Legislative corps.&mdash;&mdash;Several distinguished
Frenchmen have died during the month. Marshal
<span class="smcap">Marmont</span>, Duke of Ragusa, the last of the Marshals
of Napoleon, died at Venice on the 2d of March. He
received his highest military title on the battle field
of Wagram. He forsook Napoleon's cause when
Napoleon was falling, held high offices under the
restoration, and has lived in exile since 1830. Having
forsaken Napoleon in 1814, and opposed the revolution
of July, his name was erased from the list of
Marshals by Louis Philippe's Government, and a
black vail drawn over his portrait in the Hall of the
Marshals at the Tuileries.&mdash;&mdash;<span class="smcap">Armand Marrast</span>,
who acquired distinction as editor of the <i>National</i> and
by his close connection with the provisional government
of 1848, died March 10.&mdash;&mdash;The President has
offered a prize of fifty thousand francs in favor of the
author of the discovery which shall render the pile of
Volta applicable with economy, whether to industrial
operations, as a source of heat, or to illumination, or
to chemistry, or to mechanics, or to practical medicine.
Scientific men of all nations are admitted to
compete for the prize. The competition shall remain
open for the space of five years.&mdash;&mdash;He has also presented
to M. Leon Foucault, the young <i>savant</i> of
Paris, distinguished for his works on electricity and
light, and especially for the experiment with the <i>pendulum</i>
illustrative of the earth's rotary motion, the
sum of ten thousand francs.</p>

<p>On the 21st of March, the President reviewed the
troops, and bestowed upon them the medal, instituted
by the confiscation of the Orleans estates. In the
speech which he made to them upon the occasion, he
said, his object in instituting this medal was to make
some more adequate compensation for the services
of the army, than they usually received. It secures
to each soldier, who shall have it, an annuity of 100
francs for life; the sum is small, but the evidence of
merit, which the medal carries with it, adds to its
value. He urges them to receive it as an encouragement
to maintain intact their military spirit. "Wear
it," he says, "as a proof of my solicitude for your interest,
and my affection for that great military family
of which I am proud to be the head, because you are
its glorious children."</p>

<p>The demands of France upon <span class="smcap">Belgium</span> were mentioned
in our last Record. It is stated that they have
been boldly met and repelled. The King of Belgium at
once made an appeal to England and the Continental
courts, and he has received from all the European
Powers the most positive assurance that they will
not suffer any aggressive step whatever of Louis
Napoleon against Belgium. The French Cabinet
had required the Belgian Government to remove the
Lion which had been placed on the field of Waterloo;
but that demand was refused. It is said, upon reliable
authority, that the "decree" for annexing Belgium
to France had been prepared and even sent to the
<i>Moniteur</i> for publication; and was only withdrawn
in consequence of the strenuous opposition of those
who have more prudence than the President, and
who fortunately possess some influence over him.</p>

<p>The Paris correspondence of the London <i>Morning
Chronicle</i>, furnishes the details of a diplomatic correspondence
between the principal Continental Powers,
which has decided interest and importance. It is
stated that, on the 7th of February, Prince Schwarzenberg
addressed a note to the representatives of
Austria at St. Petersburg and Berlin, in which he
urged that the object of the Northern Powers ought
now to be to put down all that remained of constitutional
government on the continent of Europe; and
that for this purpose they ought to insist on the representative
form of government being abolished in
all the States where it was still tolerated, and more
especially in Piedmont and in Greece. He further
declared that Louis Napoleon, by his <i>coup d'&eacute;tat</i> of
the 2d of December, which, while it put an end to
constitutional government, restored military government
in France, had merited the applause of all the
Northern Powers, and he suggested that they ought
to concur in giving him their united and cordial support,
even to the exclusion of both branches of the
House of Bourbon, because none of the members
of that illustrious House could reascend the throne
without according representative government in some
shape. The representatives of Austria at Berlin and
St. Petersburg having been directed to communicate
this dispatch to the governments to which they were
accredited, did so, but the manner in which the communication
was received by the two Powers was
very different. The Prussian government at once
declared that it strongly disapproved of the suggestion
of the Austrian government, and that, as it looked
upon a certain degree of constitutional freedom as
necessary in the present state of Europe, it highly
disapproved of the attempt of Louis Napoleon to
establish a military despotism. The Russian Czar,
who sets up as the arbiter of all that is done to Germany,
gave a very characteristic answer to both
Powers. He recommended to the Austrian government
not to be so enthusiastic in its admiration of
Louis Napoleon, and to the Prussian government,
not to be so determined in its hostility to that personage;
and thus, says the writer, the affair for the
present rests.</p>

<p>Concerning the <span class="smcap">Swiss</span> question, we have more
authentic intelligence. The French diplomatic agent
at Berne had delivered to the Federal Authorities a
note, dated January 25th, containing an explicit demand
from Louis Napoleon, "That the formal promise
be made to me that all the expulsions of refugees
which I may ask be accorded to me, without any examination
as to what category the French political
refugees affected by this measure belong; and, in
addition, that the orders of the central power be executed
according to terms prescribed in advance,
without being mitigated or wholly disregarded by the
cantonal authorities, as I can prove, by examples, has
been done in previous instances. The French embassador
only is in a condition to know the individuals
whose former connections and present relations
render impossible the prolongation of their stay in the
territory of the Helvetic Confederation; as also those
who can be tolerated provisionally, if their future
conduct renders them worthy of this tolerance. The
first should depart from the moment that I have designated
them by name. The others should be told
that they can continue to reside in Switzerland only
on condition that they give no reason for complaint."
It seems scarcely possible that so peremptory and insulting
a demand should have been made, even by the
French autocrat, upon any independent power; but
the text of the letter is given. Austria also made a
similar requisition; and the <i>Assembl&eacute;e Nationale</i> says
that the Cabinet of Vienna distinctly announced to
the Federal Council its intention to occupy the canton
of Ticino with Austrian troops, unless the demands
for the expulsion of certain refugees were
complied with, and guarantees given for preventing
their return, as well as the renewal of conspiracies
against the peace of Lombardy. Prince Schwarzenberg
sent instructions to M. Hubner, the Austrian
embassador at Paris, to propose to the French government<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_839" id="Page_839">[Pg 839]</a></span>
a simultaneous action in the same views, and
the occupation of Geneva and the canton of Vaud by
the French troops. The government of Louis Napoleon
declined to co-operate with Austria in invading
the Swiss territory; and Austria was also persuaded
to desist from this enterprise. The firm attitude
of the cabinets of London and Berlin, backed
perhaps by the counsels of Russia, is supposed to
have procured this result. But no sooner was the
project of the joint violation of the neutral territory
baffled, than a new scheme was adopted by the two
conspiring Powers, which threatens to be equally
ruinous to Switzerland. The French and Austrian
governments have entered into a convention for the
commercial blockade of that country. In order to carry
this into effect Piedmont must be forced to join the
league and stop her frontier against Swiss commerce.
In the way of such a result stand the government of
Sardinia and British influence at the court of Turin.
How much these will avail remains to be seen.
Subsequent advices state that Switzerland had acceded
to all the President's requisitions&mdash;they having
been repeated in less offensive terms.</p>

<p>From <span class="smcap">Germany</span> there is no news of interest. The
Emperor of Austria left Vienna, February 25th, for
Trieste and Venice, to meet the Grand Prince of
Prussia. The Second Chamber of Wurtemberg, in
its sitting of the 26th, adopted, by 54 votes to 32,
resolutions, declaring that the fundamental rights
proclaimed by the National Assembly of Frankfort
continue to have legal force in the kingdom, and can
only be abolished in the form presented by the Constitution.
The Chamber rejected, by 66 votes to 20,
a resolution protesting against certain measures of
the Germanic Diet; and it rejected, by 48 votes to
38, a motion relative to the dissolution of the Chamber
in 1850. M. de Plessen, after these votes, made
a declaration, in the name of the Government, that
the Chamber would probably be dissolved.</p>

<p>In <span class="smcap">Spain</span> it is said that the Government is about
to reinforce the garrisons of Cuba and Porto Rico by
an addition of three or four thousand men. General
Concha has been recalled from the Governorship of
Cuba; his successor, Gen. Caredo, was to sail from
Cadiz on the 20th of March. Extensive changes were
taking place in all departments of the public service.</p>


<h3>THE EAST.</h3>

<p>From <span class="smcap">Turkey</span> we learn that Reschid Pasha,
whose dismissal was noted in our last, has been received
to favor again, and restored to office. The
Sultan has lately shown his magnanimity to rebels
against his authority, by bestowing upon Aziz Bey
and his brother Ahmed Bey, rebel Kurdish chiefs,
near Bagdad, conquered by the Sultan, and brought
to Constantinople six months ago, a pension of three
thousand piastres a month. This clemency to political
offenders is said to be common with the Turkish
Sovereign. The Turkish Government has recently
forbidden the loan of money to farmers at more than
eight per cent. interest: it also forbids the payment
of all engagements hitherto made at higher rates.
A third bridge has just been finished across the Golden
Horn. A splendid ball was given at the close of the
Carnival by the British Embassador, at which about
eight hundred persons were present.</p>

<p>In <span class="smcap">Persia</span> the recently dismissed Grand Vizier,
Mirza-Taghi-Khan, has been put to death, by having
his veins opened in a bath, and his treasures have
been seized by the Shah.</p>

<p>From <span class="smcap">India</span> we have news of further difficulties
between the English and the Burmese. Previous
advices stated that Commodore Lambert had complained
to the King of Ava of the conduct of the
Governor of Rangoon in refusing compliance with
certain demands of reparation for injuries sustained
by the British. The King professed a ready submission
to the Commodore's requisitions, but his sincerity
was doubted, and Commodore Lambert consequently
resolved to remain with his squadron, for
some days longer, in order to test the truth of his
suspicions. Scarcely had the new Governor or Viceroy
been placed in authority, than he commenced a
series of annoyances against all British subjects,
which rendered it imperative on the part of Commodore
Lambert to seek an interview with him, which
was not only refused, but all communication between
the shore and fleet strictly prohibited. In this war-like
aspect of affairs many of the British took refuge
on board the English vessels, while those who remained
behind desirous of securing their property,
were cast into prison. The fleet remained at anchor
for twenty-four hours on the opposite side of the
river, when intimation was received from the Viceroy
that he would fire on the squadron should the
Commodore attempt to move down the river. On
the 10th of January the Fox was towed down, and
anchored within a few hundred yards of the stockade
erected by the Viceroy, when the steamer having
returned to bring away with her a Burmese man-of-war,
was fired on, which was immediately returned
with great vigor. The enemy dispersed after some
three of them were slain. The squadron then proceeded
on its course, and the river ports of Burmah
were proclaimed to be in a state of blockade. Commodore
Lambert then proceeded to Calcutta for further
instructions. Another campaign was therefore
deemed unavoidable, which, it was supposed, could
not be commenced before October.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2>Editor's Table.</h2>


<p>Credulity and skepticism are often, in
fact, but different aspects of one and the same
state of mind. No man is more credulous than the
infidel in respect to all that would make against the
truth of Christianity. Hindoo legends, Chinese
chronologies, unmeaning Egyptian hieroglyphics, are
suffered at once to outweigh the clearest declarations
of that volume which alone sheds light on history,
and solves the otherwise inexplicable problem of our
humanity.</p>

<p>Nowhere is this remark more strikingly exemplified
than in the pretensions of what may be called
the pseudo-spiritualism of the day. Men whose
credulity can not digest the supernatural of the Bible
are most remarkably easy of belief in respect to
spiritual rappings, and spiritual table-liftings, and
spiritual communications in Hebrew translated into
ungrammatical and false-spelled English. Prophecy
and inspiration are irrational; the belief in a Divine
regenerating influence on the human soul is superstitious
and fanatical; but clairvoyance and <i>clairvoyant
prevision</i>, and mental alchemy are embraced without
difficulty, by the professors of this more transcendent
faith. They see and feel nothing of that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_840" id="Page_840">[Pg 840]</a></span>
grandeur of conception, that holy seriousness, that
impressive truthfulness of style, that superhuman
elevation above all that associates itself with the absurd,
the grotesque, the low, and the malignant&mdash;in
a word, those traits which every where characterize
the miraculous of the Scriptures, and have ever
awed the most thoughtful into a recognition of its
reality. And yet some of these lecturers and <i>professors</i>
have even the impudence to baptize their
naturalistic jargon with the name of spiritualism,
and while treating the human soul with less reverence
than is justly due to the lowest form even of
vegetable life, dare to talk of the <i>moral</i> uses of their
pretended science, as though it had any more place
for the word and the idea than might be found in the
jerking automaton of the toy-shop.</p>

<p>Sometimes the pretense can be characterized by
no milder term than mocking blasphemy. One of
these impostors, who has made some noise lately, is
said to have accurately foretold the words and ideas
of a discourse which was to be delivered by another
person on a subsequent day. It was no hypothetical
prediction, grounded on a scientific calculation of
assumed causes and effects, but, in fact, a <i>clairvoyant
prevision</i>, not from any Divine impression (an
idea which this blasphemous pretender is known
wholly to deride), but from a transcendent subjective
state of his natural intelligence. And yet some who
are known to believe only in an ideal Christ, and an
ideal resurrection, are not ashamed to signify a half
assent to this monstrous assertion of one of the highest
conceivable attributes of the Almighty. Every
one who thinks at all must see that here there is no
possible middle ground. It is this claim, awfully
profane and daring as it is, or a downright imposture.</p>

<p>There is nothing derogatory to the human mind in
the belief of the <i>marvelous</i>. In fact, such belief is an
element of its higher life. The wonder is, that there
is not more of it. But no degree of evidence can
justify us in giving credence to the <i>absurd</i>. The
ridiculous is ever proof of the presence of falsehood.
The higher we rise in the scale of truth, the more do
we find ourselves ascending into a region of seriousness.
An impression of a sterner reality, of a deeper
interest, of more dread importance, of a more solemn
consistency, accompanies every genuine advance.
Truth, as it grows purer and clearer, is ever found
to be more and more a fearful thing&mdash;joyful, indeed,
and soul-inspiring, yet finding the very fullness and
solidity of its joy in that graver element which gives
it its highest and most real interest for the human
soul. A faith that has no awe proves itself a delusion.
A religion that has no fear, or is not deeply
solemn, is a contradiction in terms. For the absurd
and the ridiculous even pure falsehood is too stern
a thing. They have their existence only in that grotesque
mixture of truth and error, in which the distortion
of the one concealing the malignity of the
other gives birth to all revolting and ludicrous monstrosities.</p>

<p>We need no better test. Apply it to the supernatural
of the Scriptures, and it furnishes one of the
strongest evidences of their truth. So serious a
book can not be a lie. Bring to this criterion the
modern charlatanry, which so wantonly assumes the
name of faith, "obtruding itself with its fleshly mind"
into the domain of the true supernatural, and yet denying
the supernatural&mdash;bring it to this criterion, we
say, and it is at once shown to be "earthly, sensual,
devilish"&mdash;a grotesque reflection of some of the
worst things of this world thrown back in lurid distortion
from the darkness visible of the Satanic
realms. But even this may be assigning to it too
high a rank. The position can not be charged with
irrationality which assumes that the "mocking fiend"
may sometimes be permitted to practice his jugglings
on those rash fools, who would venture too near to
his domain of falsehood. But in most of the modern
cases of this kind, we are beginning to have little
doubt that sheer imposture is the predominant if not
the only element.</p>

<p>On the outward evidence, however, we can not at
present dwell, since it is with the reasoning of these
charlatans we design that our brief strictures shall
be mainly occupied. In this, too, we find the proof
of falsehood. For we return again to our text&mdash;the
marvelous may be believed, the absurd no amount
of evidence can prove. And here some thoughts
suggest themselves to which we must give expression.
What amount of solid thinking, what discrimination
of ideas, what right knowledge of words,
what degree of logical training, which, although not
the discoverer of truth, is the surest guard against
error&mdash;in a word, what amount of general, solid,
mental culture must there be in an age distinguished
for the extensive circulation and approbation of such
works as Davis's Revelations of Nature, and Davis's
Great Harmonia, and Dodd's Psychology, &amp;c., &amp;c.?
Could it have been so when Butler wrote his immortal
Analogy; or, farther back, when Howe preached
his Living Temple as evening lectures to a country
congregation, and Baxter's tracts were found in every
hamlet in England? Could it have been so in our
own land, when Edwards preached his deep theology
to plain men in plain New England villages?
The marvelous, we may well suppose, would have
had no lack of believers in those days. But would
such absurdities in reasoning have ever gained currency
in those thinking though little scientific periods?
With all our talk of science, and progress, and universities,
and common schools, and the schoolmaster
being abroad in the land, there must be, somewhere,
something wrong in our most modern ideas and modern
modes of education. Is not the physical element
too predominant, and is it not to the common smatterings
in this department that such a pretended
spiritualism, yet real materialism, is directly to be
traced? A superficial sciolism, extensive enough in
its facts, but utterly hollow in its philosophy, is the
food with which the common mind is every where
crammed even to satiety, while there is such a serious
lack of the logical, the theological, the Biblical,
the classical, the historical&mdash;in short, of those elements
which must furnish the foundation of all right
thinking, and without which other knowledge is more
likely to lead to error than to truth.</p>

<p>But we can at present only hint at this. In respect
to the reasonings of these scientific discoverers (as
they claim to be), we may say that their fallacies get
currency from this very cause, namely, the general
want of discrimination in respect to the true bounds
of fundamental ideas, and that abuse of language
which is the necessary result. If the consequences
were not so serious, nothing could be more amusing
than their pretensions, or their method. They would
have us believe that they are the martyrs&mdash;Galileos&mdash;Bacons&mdash;Harveys,
all of them. Each one is a suffering
Servetus, while all the bigotry of the theological
world, with all its inquisitorial priests and furious
Calvins, is ever ready to crush their new science,
and give the crown of martyrdom to its devoted teachers.</p>

<p>They have, too, the sagacity to perceive that audiences,
in general, love to be addressed in the technics
of a scientific style, whether rightly used or
not. The vender of quack medicines has discovered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_841" id="Page_841">[Pg 841]</a></span>
the same secret; and hence he, too, has his array of
causes and effects, and fluids, and mediums, and counteracting
forces, and grand systems of circulation,
and positive and negative states. To be thus addressed
raises the hearer or reader at once in his own
estimation, and thus prepares him, sometimes, for the
reception of almost any kind of nonsense. He acquires,
too, an interest in these high matters; and if
not himself an actual martyr to science, becomes at
least a sympathizer with those who are doomed to
all this infamous persecution.</p>

<p>The usual course has now become so stereotyped,
that one who has attended a number of lectures of
this kind, will be able to predict the general method
of remark quite as well as Davis is said to have foretold
that of Dr. Bushnell. He will be certain of the
very places where the peculiar and most original cant
of the school will be sure to come in. He will know
just when and where to look out for Galileo and the
priests, and the Puritans and the Quakers, and Fulton
and the steam-engine. He anticipates precisely the
spot where the lecturer will tell us how Bacon "used
up" the Stagyrite, and how wonderfully knowledge
has grown since that remarkable event, and how all
previous progress was preparatory to this new science,
which it has been reserved for our bold martyr
not only to discover in its elements, but to present
full formed and full grown to his astonished hearers,&mdash;and
which, moreover, he generously offers to teach to
private classes (the ladies to be by themselves) at the
exceedingly reasonable rate of ten dollars per course.</p>

<p>Sometimes the whole of this scientific claptrap will
consist of the dextrous use of some one long new-coined
term, very much like those that are invented
for the venders of soaps and perfumes to express the
psychology of their most ingenious and philosophical
compounds. The lecturer has discovered a new word,
and it stands to him in place of a mine of thought. In
Martinus Scriblerus we read of a project to banish
metaphysics out of Spain. It was to be done by forbidding
the use of the compounds and decompounds
of the substantive verb. "Take away from the scholastic
metaphysician," says this ingenious reformer,
"his <i>ens</i>, his <i>entitas</i>, his <i>essentia</i>, &amp;c., and there is an
end of him." So also we have known lectures, and
even books, on some of these new psychologies from
which the abstraction of a single term would cause
the whole to collapse. And yet to the quackish lecturer
it is the key to unlock all his scientific treasures.
He has somehow picked up a <i>word</i>, and he is
deluding himself, and trying to delude others, into
the notion that he has really caught an <i>idea</i>. The
connection of soul and body is no longer a mystery.
Science has at length dragged it out of its dark retreat.
Nothing can be simpler than the explanation at length
afforded of the fact which had so long baffled all inquiry.
It is wholly owing to the <i>nervo-vital</i> fluid. But
how is this? Is this connecting medium mind, or
matter, or a compound of both, or a tertium quid?
If it is either the first or the second, the mystery is
just where it was before. If it be said that it is the
last (the only answer which does not at once annihilate
itself), the further query arises&mdash;How is that to be a
medium which needs itself a medium, or rather two
other distinct media, to serve as connecting links between
it and the two worlds it would unite? Or is
it a bridge without an abutment on either shore?</p>

<p>But what are all such difficulties to our modern
Galileo, or to his scientific audience? It is the <i>nervo-vital</i>
fluid, whether or no. There is a charming philosophy
in the very sound, and it is impossible that so
good a term should not mean something. It is an admirable
word&mdash;a most euphonic word&mdash;and since the
parts are certainly significant, there can be no reason
why the whole compound should not be so likewise.</p>

<p>Another of these magic words is <i>electricity</i>. It is
getting to be the <i>universal solvent</i> for all scientific
difficulties. It is life, it is gravitation, it is attraction,
it is generation, it is creation, it is development,
it is law, it is sensation, it is thought, it is every
thing. "Give me a place to put my lever," said Archimedes,
"and I will move the world!" Give us
electricity and nervo-vital fluids, say our biologists,
and we will explain the mystery of all organizations,
from the animalcule to the universe!</p>

<p>We repeat it, The downright impositions in respect
to facts, are not so insulting to an audience, as the
quackish reasoning which is often presented by way
of explanation. To state an example: One of the
most common performances of these mountebanks
consists in the pretended control of one mind or one
person over the senses, the actions, the volitions, and
even the moral states of another. The performance
is generally contemptible enough in itself, but it is
rendered still more so when our man of science undertakes,
as he generally does, to explain to his audience
the profound rationale of his proceedings.
The lecturer most modestly and reverently disclaims
for himself the possession of supernatural powers. It
is all science&mdash;all strictly in accordance with "<i>natural
laws</i>" and performed on the most rational and
scientific principles. He had broken no law of mind
or matter, as he would make perfectly level to the
understandings of his most respectable auditory. The
grand agent in the whole process was electricity, or
the nervo-vital fluid. By means of this, the mind
of the operator was transferred to the soul of the subject,
and hence it is perfectly plain that the emotions
and mental exercises of the one become the emotions
and mental exercises of the other. A terrific scene
was fancied (in the case which we have now in mind it
was a picture of serpents), and the patient was thrown
into a state of most agitating fright. Now that an impostor,
or a juggler, might deceive the senses of an
audience, is nothing incredible, and implies nothing
derogatory to their intelligence. That some physical
effect may have been produced on the nervous system
of some peculiarly sensitive subject, is by no means
beyond belief; or that in some way, explicable or inexplicable,
the agitation and convulsion may have
had a real existence. So far it may have been wholly
false, or partly false and partly real. Again, whether
there may or may not be unknown fluids through
which one mind or one body affects another, is not
the question. If it were so, it would only be analogous
to the ordinary modes of mediate communication
by air, and light, and sound, and would be liable
in kind, if not in degree, to the same imperfections.
Still would it be true, whatever the media, ordinary
or extraordinary, that only as mind is communicated
to mind <i>as it really is</i>, can one affect the emotions, and
exercises, and states of the other. There may be
less, there never can be more, in the effect than in
the cause.</p>

<p>Here, then, is the palpable absurdity, which should
bring a blush of shame upon every audience, and
every individual calling himself rational, who is for
a moment affected by it. The mind of the operator,
it is maintained, is, for the time being, the mind of
the patient. It has taken possession of his thinking
and feeling province. This is the philosophy that
Aristotle never knew, and of which even Bacon
hardly had a glimpse. Let us test it. As the lecturer
is a very frank and fearless man, he invites
the fullest examination, not only of his facts, but of
his reasoning. Some one may, therefore, be supposed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_842" id="Page_842">[Pg 842]</a></span>
to present the following or similar questions:
You <i>willed</i>, did you, the scene and the state of mind
which produced these alarming results? Exactly so.
Was it, then, a simple volition of the <i>effect</i>, as an
effect (if such a thing were possible), or accompanied
in your own mind, by a conception of the scene
presented? Certainly, replies the triumphant lecturer,
the whole rationale, as you have been told,
consisted in throwing my mind into that of the subject.
He thought what I thought&mdash;he felt what I
felt. Very well. But were you frightened at the
snakes? Did terror constitute any part of the exercises
of your own mind? This is a puzzler, but
there is an apparent way of surmounting the difficulty.
The patient, it may be said, <i>believes</i> in the
reality of the scene presented, while the operator
does not. But this only suggests a still greater absurdity.
This belief, or non-belief, is certainly a
very important part of the mental and emotional
state. How comes one of the most essential ingredients
to be left behind in the psychological transfer?
Does the operator <i>will</i> it thus to be? We have never
heard any such thing alleged; but if it were so, it
would only be the crowning folly of this superlatively
foolish process&mdash;this very lunacy of nonsense. Such
volition itself would then become a part of the mental
state, and must pass over to the patient along
with the other thoughts and emotions, and with all
the absurdity involved in it, or require another volition
to keep it back, and still another volition for this,
and so on, <i>ad infinitum</i>. Have any of our readers
ever seen a foolish dog running round and round after
his own tail, and ever jerking it away just when he
seemed to himself to be on the point of catching it?
Nothing can furnish a better illustration of the exceeding
folly that has often in this way been presented
as profound and scientific reasoning to what have
been styled enlightened and respectable audiences.</p>

<p>There is another fallacy running through all these
pretended sciences&mdash;from phrenology and phreno-mesmerism
to the most stupid exhibitions that have
been ever given, under the names of "electrical
psychology" and "mental alchemy." It is that view
which, in effect, wholly denies any thing like a spiritual
unity to the human soul, making it a series of
separate impulses, or, like the keys of a piano, each
when struck from without giving an isolated sound.
Let one be touched, the machine lifts up its hand,
and is supposed to pray. Strike another, and it blasphemes.
And so, by turns, it hates and loves, and
fears and trusts&mdash;not different objects, which would
be perfectly consistent with a spiritual unity, in which
the whole moral and intellectual state is represented
in every exercise, but the same objects, and with
transitions so sudden as to be almost simultaneous.
We might, in a similar way, expose the absurd reasoning
contained in all this, but we would rather dwell
at present on the moral aspect of the case&mdash;the shocking
irreverence it manifests toward the human soul,
making its faith, its reason, its love, its conscience,
as worthless as the lowest bodily appetites&mdash;sinking
it, indeed, below the dignity of respectable organic or
inorganic matter, with which such tricks can not be
played, and reducing all that have heretofore been
regarded as the highest moral truths to the rank of
physical phenomena.</p>

<p>In some former remarks of our Editorial Table, there
was an allusion to the revolting claim clairvoyance
makes to meddle with the soul's sacred individuality.
The thought is applicable to all those kindred pretensions
which are now so rife. Their tendency is to
destroy all reverence for our own spirituality, and
with it all reverence for the truly spiritual every-where.
If this be true of what is called biology and
mental alchemy, in a still more impressive sense
may it be charged upon that other compound of blasphemy
and Satanic mummery, which has grown directly
out of them. We allude to the pretense of
holding intercourse with departed spirits through
mesmerized mediums, or what are usually called
<i>spiritual rappings</i>. The first class of performances are
an insult to the human intelligence; this is a moral
outrage upon the most tender, the most solemn, the
most religious feelings of our nature. The one is a
profane trifling with all that is most sacred in life&mdash;the
other is a violation of the grave, and of all beyond,
of which it is the appointed vail. It is hard to write
or speak with calmness here. The mischief done and
doing in this direction, defies all proper estimate.
These proceedings are sending lunatics to our asylums,
but this is by no means the sorest evil that may
be laid to their charge. It is the soul-hardening familiarity
they are every where producing with the
most awful subjects that can be offered for human
contemplation. Such an effect, too, in relation to the
spirit of man must soon be followed by a similar one
in respect to the still more tremendous idea of Deity.
To use a strange but most expressive term, first employed
by De Quincey (although applied to a different
subject) we know of nothing in human experience
that threatens to be so utterly <i>de-religionizing</i>&mdash;in
other words, so fatally destructive of all that reverence
for the spiritual, that awe of the unseen, that
tender emotion, as well as solemn interest, which
connect themselves with the idea of the other life,
and without which religion itself, in any form, can
have no deep or permanent hold upon the mind. We
find it difficult to conceive how any man possessed
of the smallest share of these holy sympathies, can
bring himself to give any countenance whatever to
such practices. We appeal to those who have lost
the nearest relatives&mdash;a parent, a brother, a sister, a
dear departed child&mdash;how should every right feeling
of the soul revolt against the thought of holding intercourse
with them, even though it were possible,
through such means? Who that has a Christian heart
would not prefer the silence of the grave to the
thought of the dear departed one in the midst of such
imaginings, and such scenic associations as are connected
with the usual performances of this kind?
Through that silence of the grave the voice of faith
may be heard speaking to us in the language of revelation&mdash;<i>He
is not dead but sleepeth</i>. Blessed word,&mdash;so
utterly unknown to all previous philosophy&mdash;never
heard in any other revelation than that of the
gospel! They are not dead but <i>sleep</i>. "They enter
into <i>peace</i>," says the prophet. And then the precious
and consoling addition&mdash;They sleep <i>in Jesus</i>. Surely
the term thus employed can imply no cessation of
consciousness, no torpor of the higher and better
faculties of the soul; but it does denote, beyond all
doubt, a state of rest, of calmness, of security, of undisturbed
and beatific vision&mdash;a state far removed
from all resemblance to this bustling life&mdash;a state in all
respects the opposite of that which fancy pictures as
belonging to the scenes presented in the manifestations
of spiritual rappings, and spiritual table-liftings,
and, in a word, those spiritual pantomimes, which
seem to be becoming more and more extravagant and
grotesque in proportion to the infidel credulity with
which they are received.</p>

<p>Such are every where the scriptural ideas in respect
to the condition of the pious dead, and from the
other class we seek not to draw that vail which it
has thrown over them. Nothing shows more strikingly
the extreme secularity of the age in which we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_843" id="Page_843">[Pg 843]</a></span>
live than the disposition, even among many who are
professedly religious, to look upon the other world as
only a continuation of the activities of the present;
but we affirm with all boldness, that such a view receives
no support from the Bible. Rest, security,
calmness, peace, removal from all agitation, from all
excitement, from all commingling in the scenes of
this busy, restless, probationary life&mdash;these are the
thoughts which are suggested by its parables, its
metaphors, its visions, its direct and positive assertions.
Especially clear and prominent is the idea of
entire separation from the present world. They have
"entered into rest"&mdash;they are in "Abraham's bosom"&mdash;they
are "with Christ in Paradise." To the
same effect would the spiritually-minded reader interpret
certain phrases employed in the Older Scriptures.
They are in "the secret of his pavilion," in
the "hiding-place of his tabernacle"&mdash;they abide
"under the shadow of the Almighty." Such expressions
may have a meaning in connection with this
life; but their fullest import is only brought out when
their consoling assurances are referred to the state
of the departed in the spirit-world.</p>

<p>And here the thought most naturally suggests itself&mdash;How
striking the difference between the sensual
obtrusiveness, the impious pretensions, the profane
curiosity exhibited in connection with this modern
charlatanry, and what may be called the <i>solemn
reserve</i> of the Holy Scriptures. The Bible never condescends
to gratify our curiosity respecting what may
be called the physiology, or <i>physical</i> theory of the
other life. On the other hand, the <i>moral</i> effect is
ever kept in view, and to this, in all its communications,
it ever aims at giving the deepest intensity.
In the light of this thought let any one contrast the
sublime vision of Eliphaz (Job iv.) with any of these
modern spiritual manifestations. The vail is for a
moment withdrawn. A light just gleams upon us
from the spirit-world, not to show us things within,
but to cast its moral irradiation upon things without.
The formless form, the silence, and the voice leave
all things physical, or psychological as much unknown
as before; but how deep the moral impression!
There are no disclosures of the scenery or topography
of the unseen state; no announcement of "great
truths about to break forth;" nothing said of "throwing
down barriers between the two worlds." But instead
of this, a most solemn declaration of a Divine
moral government, and a moral retribution, to which
all that is physical, or physiological, or psychological
even, is intended ever to be kept subservient.</p>

<p>Thus it is throughout the Bible. Paul had visions
of the third Heavens. Christ descended into Hades,
and rose again; but he has told us nothing of the
state or doings of departed spirits. Where the sacred
penmen draw back, and scarce afford a hint,
except as to the certainty of retribution in another
world, modern mystics, modern impostors have given
us volumes.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i8">Fools rashly venture in<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where angels dare not tread.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>And so, too, in respect to death itself. The impostor
Davis profanely assumes to describe the process
of the elimination of the spirit from the struggling
body, and some have pronounced the unfeeling
caricature worthy of the genius of Dante or of Milton.
But with what solemn reserve does the Scripture
cast a vail over this dread event, and reveal to
us only its moral consequences. It is a going down
into a "Valley of Shadows," and all that the believer
is allowed to know of it is, that in that Valley
there is one to take him by the hand, one who will
walk with him through its darkness, and "whose rod
and staff shall comfort him" through all that dreary
way. To this correspond the terms expressive of the
idea in primitive languages. It is a going into <i>Hades</i>,
the <i>Invisible</i>, the <i>Unknown</i>, not in the sense of any
doubt, implied as to the real existence of a spirit
world (for men have never been without a distinct belief
in this, as matter of fact), but unknown as to its
physical states and modes of being. In the Hebrew
it is <i>Beth Olam</i>, the <i>Hidden House</i> (imperfectly rendered
<i>the long home</i>, Eccles. xii.), where the souls
of the dead take no part in things that are done beneath
the sun." The living go to them, but they come
not back any more to us. And what right-feeling
heart would have it otherwise. They are</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Not dead, but parted from their house of clay.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>They still dwell, too, in our memories; they are enshrined
in our hearts. Who would not trust them to
the Scripture promises of rest and peace, rather than
imagine them as subject to the unrest, and sharing
in the agitating and tumultuous scenes of this pseudo-spiritualism.
The believer in rappings charges
his opponent with a Sadducean lack of faith. But
we would take issue with him on the term. The
naturalistic spirit-hunter is a stranger to the idea.
With him it is only the sensualism and sensual
scenes of this earth carried into a supposed spiritual
world. It is a faith which has no trust, no patient
waiting. It is not "the evidence of things unseen."
It is not "the substance of things hoped for." It is
rank materialism, after all. It is, moreover, <i>essentially</i>
irreligious. As far as it extends, it threatens,
to an awful degree, to de-religionize the human soul&mdash;not
only to take away all true spirituality of view,
but to render men incapable of those ideas, on which
alone a right religious belief can be founded.</p>

<p>We hope our readers will not think that we have
indulged in a train of thought too serious or sombre
for the pages of a literary Monthly Magazine. It is
directly forced upon us by our subject, if we would
treat it as it deserves to be treated; and our only
apology for choosing such a theme, is found in the
fact that it is connected with one of the most wide-spread
and mischievous delusions of the day. We
should indeed think that we had discharged a most
important editorial duty, could we only convey to the
many thousands of our readers our deep impression,
not only of the falsehood and wickedness of these
"<i>lying wonders</i>," but also of the immense moral evil
of which they threaten to be the cause.</p>

<h2>Editor's Easy Chair.</h2>


<p>The Spring hangs fire, like a rusty match-lock;
and even as we write&mdash;though the almanac tells
stories of "pleasant showers about this time"&mdash;the
snow-flakes are dappling the distant roofs, and shivering
under a northern wind. The early-trout fishers
upon the south-shore of the Island, are bandaged
in pea-coats, and the song-making blue-birds twitter
most scattered and sorry orisons.</p>

<p>It is a singular circumstance&mdash;and one of which the
meteorologic men must give us the resolution&mdash;that
the seasons of the Eastern and Western Continents
balance themselves so accurately as they do. Thus,
the severe winter which, leaning from the Arctic Circle,
has touched our Continent with an icy <i>right</i> hand,
has kindled with a warm <i>left</i>, the north of Europe
into a premature Spring. The journalists tell us of
flowers blooming in Norway, through all the latter
half of February; and the winter in Paris has proved
as sham a winter, as their Republic is sham republic.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_844" id="Page_844">[Pg 844]</a></span>
Is there any tide of atmosphere which makes flux
and reflux of cold&mdash;kindred to the sweep of the ocean?
And may not that Northern Centre, which geographers
call the <span class="smcap">Pole</span>, have such influence on the atmospheric
currents, as the moon is said to have upon
the sea?</p>

<hr />

<p>Poor Sir John, meantime, shivering in the Northern
Regions, or&mdash;what is far more probable&mdash;sealed
up in some icy shroud, that keeps his body whole,
and that will not break or burst until the mountains
melt&mdash;is not forgotten. Even now the British Admiralty
are fitting out another expedition, to flounder
for a season among the icebergs, and bring back its
story of Polar nights, and harsh Arctic music.</p>

<p>A little bit of early romance, associated with the
great navigator, has latterly found its way into the
journals, and added new zest to the talk of his unknown
fate. Lady Franklin was, it appears, in her
youthful days, endowed with the same poet-soul&mdash;which
now inspires her courage, and which then inspired
her muse. Among other rhymed thoughts
which she put in print, were some wild, weird verses
about the Northern realms, and the bold navigators
who periled life and fortune among the Polar mountains.
The verses caught the eye and the sympathies
of Sir John Franklin. He traced them to their
source, and finding the heart of the lady as true and
brave, as her verse was clear and sound, he challenged
her love, and won such wife as became the
solace of his quieter days, and the world-known
mourner of his fate.</p>

<hr />

<p>Domestic talk plays around the topic of the coming
Presidential campaign, and not a dinner of the
whole Lenten season but has turned its chat upon
this hinge. And it is not a little curious to observe
how the names of the prospective Presidents narrow
down, as the time approaches, to some two or three
focal ones, toward which converge all the rays of calumny
and of laudation. Yet in this free speech&mdash;thanks
to our privilege&mdash;we offer a most happy contrast
to that poor shadow of a Republic, which is now
thriving in embroidered Paris coats, and whose history
is written under the ban of Censors. It is amusing
to recall now the speeches of those earnest
French Republicans, who, in the debates of 1848,
objected so strongly to any scheme of representation
which should bear that strong federal taint that belonged
to our system. "It is an off-shoot," said they,
"of British and lordly birth, and can not agree with
the nobler freedom which we have established, and
which has crowned our Revolution."</p>

<p>May God, in his own good time, help the French&mdash;if
they will not help themselves&mdash;and give them no
worse a ruler, than the poorest of our present candidates!</p>

<hr />

<p>Some little time ago we indulged in a pleasant
strain of self-gratulation, that the extraordinary woman,
Lola Montes&mdash;<i>danseuse</i>, <i>diplomate</i>, widow, wife,
<i>femme entretenue</i>&mdash;should have met with the humblest
welcome upon American shores, and by such welcome
given a lift to our sense of propriety. It would
seem, however, that the welcome was only stayed,
and not abandoned. The cordial reception which
our national representatives have given the Bavarian
Countess, was indeed a matter to be looked for. Proprieties
of life do not rule high under the Congressional
atmosphere; nor is Washington the moving
centre of much Christian enterprise&mdash;either missionary
or other. But that Boston, our staid rival, should
have shown the <i>danseuse</i> the honor of Educational
Committees, and given her speech in French and
Latin of the blooming Boston girls, is a thing as
strange as it was unexpected. We observe, however,
that the officer in attendance upon Lola, pleads
simple courtesy as a warrant for his introduction,
and regrets that newspaper inquiry and comment
should make known to his pupil-<i>prot&eacute;g&eacute;es</i> the real
character of the lady introduced. It certainly is unfortunate&mdash;but
still more unfortunate, that the character
of any visitor should not be proof against inquiry.</p>

<p>Lola, it seems, resents highly any imputation upon
her good name, and demands proof of her losses.</p>

<p>Her indignation is adroit, and reminds us of a certain
old "nut for the lawyers," which once went the
round of the almanacs:</p>

<p>"Will Brown, a noted toper, being out of funds,
and put to his wits, entered the beer-shop, and called
for four two-penny loaves of bread. After ruminating
awhile, with the loaves under his arm, he proposed
to exchange a couple of the loaves for a mug of ale.
Bruin of the bar assented to the bargain. Will quietly
disposed of his ale, and again proposed a further
exchange of the remaining loaves, for a second mug
of the malt liquor.</p>

<p>"Will quietly discharged his duty toward the second
tankard, and as quietly moved toward the door.
Bruin claimed pay. Will alleged that he had paid
in two-penny loaves. Bruin demanded pay for the
bread; but Will, very imperturbably swore that he
did not keep the bread, and challenged poor Bruin to
prove his indebtedness."</p>

<hr />

<p>Jenny Lind has latterly slipped from the public
eye into the shades of her newly-found domestic life.
Rumor, however, tells the story of one last appearance,
during the Spring, when all the world will be
curious to see how she wears her bridal state, and
to take fuller glimpse of the man, who has won her
benevolent heart. Can the married world explain to
us, how it is that matrimony seems to dull the edge
of triumph, and to round a grave over maiden glory?
Why is Madame Goldschmidt so much less than
Jenny Lind? Simply in this way: she who has
conquered the world by song and goodness, has herself
been conquered; and the conqueror, if rumor
tells a fair story, is no better, or worthier, or stronger
than the average of men. The conclusion, then,
is inevitable, that she, having yielded, is, in some
qualities of head or heart&mdash;even less than he; and so
reduced to the standard of our dull every-day mortality.</p>

<p>Rumor says again, that the songstress, after a visit
only to her own shores, is to return to the pleasant
town of Northampton for a home. The decision, if
real, does credit to our lady's love of the picturesque;
for surely a more sightly town lies no where in our
western world, than that mass of meadow and sweeping
hill which lies grouped under the shoulder of
Holyoke.</p>

<hr />

<p>With the spring-time, the city authorities are
brushing the pavements&mdash;very daintily&mdash;for the summer's
campaign. Mr. Russ is blockading the great
thoroughfare, for a new fragment of his granite road;
and "May movings," on the very day this shall come
to the eye of our reader, will be disturbing the whole
quiet of the metropolis. High rents are making the
sad burden of many a master of a household; and a
city paper has indulged in philosophical speculations
upon the influence of this rise in rent upon the matrimonial
alliance. The matter is not without its
salient points for reflection. Young ladies, whose
extravagance in dress is promoting high prices of all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_845" id="Page_845">[Pg 845]</a></span>
sorts, must remember that they are thereby cheapening
their chances of a home and a husband. The
good old times, when a thousand or two thousand a
year were reckoned sufficient income for a city man
to marry upon, and to bring up such family as Providence
vouchsafed him, are fast falling into the wake
of years.</p>

<p>A wife and a home are becoming great luxuries&mdash;not
so much measured by peace as by pence.</p>

<p>Would it not be well for domestically inclined
clerks&mdash;whose rental does not run to a large figure&mdash;to
organize (in the way of the Building Associations)
cheap Marriage Associations? We do not feel competent
to suggest the details of such a plan, but throw
out the hint for younger men to act upon.</p>

<p>It is pleasant to fancy the "Special Notices" of
the Tribune newspaper lit up with such sparkling
inducements for bachelors as these:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Bloomer Marriage Association</span> will hold
its regular meeting on Friday at half past seven.
Those who appreciate the advantages of a good wife,
at small cost, with reliable men for trustees, will not
fail to attend. The stock is now nearly all taken.
A few shares are left. Several new names of modest
and marriageable young ladies&mdash;also two thriving
widows with small families&mdash;are registered upon the
books of the Association. Every information supplied.</p>

<p class="right"><span class="smcap">Jedediah Ruletheroost</span>, <i>Secretary</i>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cheap Wives</span> for poor and deserving young men.
The <span class="smcap">Caroline Fry</span> Marriage Association is the
best and oldest of similar organizations. Hundreds
of young men are now in the enjoyment of estimable
partners for life, and all the endearments of the domestic
circle through the agency of this Association.
Shares are still to be sold, and the surplus of capital
already amounts to the incredible sum of fourteen
thousand dollars.</p>

<p>Particular attention paid to proper matching of
temperaments. Only two unfortunate marriages have
thus far been contracted under the auspices of this
Association. The best of medical advisers.</p>

<p>English Punch is busy nowadays in twisting the
Jew locks of the new leader in the House of Commons.
The personal peculiarities of Mr. Disraeli
make him an easy subject for the artists of Fleet-street.
We shall expect, however, to see some rare
debates led off by the accomplished Hebrew. Disraeli
has his weaknesses of manner and of action;
but he is a keen talker, and can make such show of
brilliant repartee as will terribly irk the leaders of
the Left.</p>

<p>The Earl of Derby, notwithstanding his fine and
gentlemanly bearing, comes in for his share of the
Punch caricature. Few British statesmen are so
accomplished and graceful speakers as the Earl of
Derby; and, with the burden of the Government
upon his shoulders, to spur his efforts, we shall confidently
look for such strong pleading, as will surpass
any thing yet heard from Lord Stanley.</p>

<p>French talk is tired of political prognostic, and
has yielded itself, with characteristic indolence and
<i>insouciance</i>, to the gayeties of the <i>mi-car&eacute;me</i>. Balls
have broken the solemnities of Lent, and a new
drama of the younger Dumas, which turns upon the
life and fortunes of a <i>courtisane</i> of the last century,
seems to chime with the humor of the time.</p>

<p>The broidered coats are thickening under imperial
auspices; and Napoleon is winning a host of firm
supporters among the broidering girls of Nancy and
of the metropolis. The Americans, it would seem,
are doing their part toward the festivities of the season;
and forget Lent and Republic, in the hilarity
of balls and routs. An American club, holding its
meetings in the old saloon of Frascati, is among the
<i>on dits</i> of the winter.</p>

<p>A proposition for shaving the beards of judges and
advocates, has wakened the apprehensions of all the
benchers; and, in defense of their old-time prerogatives,
the subjects of the proposed edict have brought
to light an old pleading for their hirsute fancies, which
may well have its place.</p>

<p>The shaved chin is an incongruity as connected
with the toga; the beard, on the contrary, is in perfect
keeping. If it had not existed by a wise provision
of Providence, it must have been invented.
What more imposing spectacle than a court rendering
a solemn decree, in the presence of both chambers&mdash;and
what measure of authority would not the white
beard of the judge give to the sentence he pronounces!</p>

<p>If then, you have a real care for your dignity, oh
magistrates, curb not the flowing beard, but rather
tempt its honors, with all the aids of art. And if the
eccentric sallies of some brother gownsman, or some
na&iuml;ve testimony of an unkempt witness, put your
gravity in peril, you can laugh&mdash;in your beard. Thus
nature will have her rights, and your dignity rest unmolested.</p>

<p>We commend these opinions to their honors of the
New York Bench; only adding, that such aldermanic
judges as are proof against wit&mdash;as they are proof
against sense, might yet value the beard to hide their

<p>All European travelers know the value and the
awkwardness of passports, and the importance of
securing them <i>en regle</i>.</p>

<p>The Count B&mdash;&mdash;, wishing latterly to pass into
Austria with a domestic and a favorite horse, sent
to the legation for the necessary papers, charging his
secretary to see that all was in order.</p>

<p>"As to the domestic," said the official, "he will
have a separate passport; but there are some formalities
as to the horse; we must have a perfect description
of him, to insert in the passport of his
owner."</p>

<p>"Very good," said the secretary, "I will send the
groom with it."</p>

<p>The embassador proceeded to fill up the passport:
"We, Envoy Extraordinary, &amp;c., invite the civil
and military authorities to allow M. le Comte, with
his horse, to pass, and in case of need, to render all
possible aid and assistance to &mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Here occurred a blank, in view of the fact that the
applicant might possess either wife or family. The
good embassador (whom it is reasonable to suppose
a bachelor) reckoning the horse equivalent to one
or the other&mdash;filled up the blank with the word
"them."</p>

<p>The signature being appended, the task of filling
up the description was left to the <i>attach&eacute;</i>.</p>

<p>In due time the groom arrived. The sub-officia
copied faithfully the description of the count's gelding.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><i>Age</i>&mdash;three years and a half.<br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Height</i>&mdash;fourteen hands.<br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Hair</i>&mdash;dark sorrel.<br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Forehead</i>&mdash;spotted with white.<br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Eyes</i>&mdash;very lively.<br /></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_846" id="Page_846">[Pg 846]</a></span><span class="i0"><i>Nose</i>&mdash;broad nostrils.<br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Mouth</i>&mdash;A little hard.<br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Beard</i>&mdash;none (the count was a veritable Turk).<br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Complexion</i>&mdash;none.<br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Private marks</i>&mdash;ears very long; small star branded on the left thigh.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>In course of time the count departed, his passport
in the guardianship of his accomplished secretary.</p>

<p>The frontier officers are not, travelers will remember,
either very brilliant men, or very witty men.
They have a dull eye for a joke.</p>

<p>The count's passport was scrutinized severely;
the description did not accord accurately, in the
opinion of the <i>sergent</i> of police, with the actual man.
The <i>sergent</i> pulled his mustache, looked wise&mdash;and
put Monsieur le Comte under arrest. The story
about the horse was a poor story. The <i>sergent</i> was
not to be outwitted in that fashion.</p>

<p>The consequence was a detention under guard for
four days, until the necessary explanations could be
returned from Paris, and the <i>sergent</i> be fully persuaded
that the description attached to the count's
horse, and not to some dangerous political refugee.</p>

<hr />

<p>Under the head of "Touching Matrimonial Confidence,"
a French provincial paper gives the following:
A certain Gazette of Auvergne published, a few
days since, this notice (not unknown to our newspaper
annals):</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"No person will give credit to the woman Ursula-Veronica-Anastasia-Cunegonde
Piot&mdash;my wife, as I
shall pay no debts of her contracting."</p></blockquote>

<p>The same Gazette published, a few days after, the
following rejoinder (which we commend to all wives
similarly situated):</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Monsieur Jerome Barnabas, my husband, could
have spared himself the trouble of his late notice.</p>

<p>"It is not to be supposed that I could get credit
on his account; for, since he pays no debts of his
own, nobody would count on him to pay any debts
of mine.</p>

<p class="right">"<span class="smcap">Femme Barnabas&mdash;nee Piot.</span>"</p>

</blockquote>

<p>We should not be greatly surprised if the precedent
here afforded, should lead to a new column of
city advertisements.</p>

<hr />

<p><i>Apropos</i> of the late balls in Paris, a very good
story is told of a bouncing student at law (with
rooms and <i>m&eacute;nage</i> in the quarter of the Pantheon),
who recently made his <i>d&eacute;b&ucirc;t</i>, under the auspices of
his father, at a ball of the Chauss&eacute;e d'Antin.</p>

<p>His father, a stout provincial, but bolstered into
importance by a fat vineyard, and wine cellars to
match, insisted upon introducing his son to the high
life of the capital. The son declined, urging that
he did not dance (the truth being that his familiarity
was only with the exceptional dances of the <i>Chaumi&egrave;re</i>
and such grisette quarters).</p>

<p>"<i>Mon Dieu</i>&mdash;not dance!" said the old gentleman.</p>

<p>"<i>Oui</i>&mdash;after a fashion, but in a way not appreciated,
I fear, in such salons."</p>

<p>The old gentleman chuckled over his son's modesty&mdash;he
could imagine it nothing else&mdash;and insisted
upon the venture. The student was a guest; but
determined to keep by the wall, as a spectator of
the refined gallopades of the quarter d'Antin. The
first look, however, at the salon polka plunged him
into a profound reverie. Was it indeed true that he
was in the elegant saloon of the <i>Marquise</i> M&mdash;&mdash;?
thought he, gaining courage.</p>

<p>It was his method precisely&mdash;the very dance that
Amy had taught him&mdash;practiced with all their picturesque
temerity. Sure of his power, and using all
the art of the <i>Mabile</i>, he gave himself up to two hours
of most exhilarating pastime.</p>

<p>"They have calumniated the <i>beau monde</i>," mused
he in leaving. "I find it very entertaining. Our
dances are not only understood, but cultivated&mdash;practiced;
and, <i>ma foi</i>, I rather prefer handling these
countesses, to those very greedy grisettes."</p>

<p>Our brave student at law might possibly find his
paces as well understood, in some American saloons
as in those of the Chaus&eacute;e d'Antin!</p>

<hr />

<p>We close our long chat for the month with a little
whimsicality of travel, which comes to us in the
letter of a friend.</p>

<p>Major M'Gowd was of Irish extraction (which he
denied)&mdash;had been in the English service (which he
boasted), and is, or was two years ago, serving under
the Austrian flag.</p>

<p>He was not a profound man; but, as majors go, a
very good sort of major, and great disciplinarian&mdash;as
the following will show:</p>

<p>You have seen the Austrian troops in review, and
must have noticed the curious way in which their
cloaks are carried around their necks, making the
poor fellows look like the Vauxhall showman, looking
out from the folds of a gigantic anaconda.</p>

<p>On one occasion, the major, being officer of the
day, observed a soldier with his cloak lying loosely
upon his arm.</p>

<p>"Where's your cloak, rascal?" was the major's
peremptory demand.</p>

<p>"Here, sir," was the reply.</p>

<p>"What's the use of a cloak if it's not rolled up?"
thundered the major; and the poor scamp was sent
to the lock-up.</p>

<p>Thus much for the major's discipline. But like
most old officers of no great depth of brain, the major
had his standard joke, which had gone the rounds
of a hundred mess-tables. Latterly, however, he had
grown coy of a repetition, and seems to cherish a
suspicion that he has not cut so good a figure in the
story as he once imagined.</p>

<p>A little after-dinner mellowness, however, is sure
to bring the major to his trump card, and in knowledge
of this, Ned and myself (who had never heard
his story), one day tempted the major's appetite with
some very generous Tokay.</p>

<p>Major M'Gowd bore up, as most old officers are
able to do, to a very late hour, and it was not till
eleven that he seemed fairly kindled.</p>

<p>"Well, major, now for the story," said we.</p>

<p>"Ah, boys, it won't do" (the major looked smilingly
through his glass), "it was really too bad."</p>

<p>"Out with it, major," and after as much refusing
and urging as would seat half the girls in New
York at the piano, the old gentleman opened:</p>

<p>"It's too bad, boys; it was the most cutting, sarcastic
thing that perhaps ever was heard. You see,
I was stationed at Uxbridge; you know Uxbridge,
p'raps&mdash;situated on a hill. I was captain, then;
young and foolish&mdash;very foolish. I wrote poetry. I
couldn't do it now. I never have since; I wish I
hadn't <i>then</i>. For, do you see, it was the most cruel,
cutting thing&mdash;"</p>

<p>The major emptied his glass.</p>

<p>"Go on, major," said Ned, filling for him again.</p>

<p>"Ah, boys&mdash;sad work&mdash;it cut him down. I was
young, as I said&mdash;stationed at Uxbridge&mdash;only a captain
then, and wrote poetry. It was there the thing
happened. It's not modest to say it, but really, a
more cutting thing&mdash;fill up your glasses, my boys.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_847" id="Page_847">[Pg 847]</a></span>
"I became acquainted with a family of the name
of Porter&mdash;friends of the colonel; pray remember
the name&mdash;Porter. There was a daughter, Miss
Porter. Keep the name in mind, if you please.
Uxbridge, as you know, is situated on a hill. About
fifteen miles away was stationed another regiment.
Now, a young officer of this regiment was very attentive
to Miss Porter; don't forget the name, I beg
of you.</p>

<p>"He was only a lieutenant, a second son&mdash;nothing
but his pay to live on; and the old people did not
fancy his attentions, being, as I said, second son,
lieutenant; which was very sensible in them.</p>

<p>"They gave him a hint or two, which he didn't
take. Finally they applied to me, Captain M'Gowd,
at that time, begging me to use my influence in the
matter. I had not the pleasure of acquaintance with
the lieutenant; though, apart from his being second
son, lieutenant, small pay, &amp;c., I knew nothing in
the world against the poor fellow.</p>

<p>"The more's the pity, boys; as I had no right to
address him directly on the subject, I determined to
hit him off in a few lines of poetry&mdash;those fatal, sarcastic
lines!" sighed the major, finishing his glass.</p>

<p>"I had the reputation of being witty, and a poet;
and though I say it myself&mdash;was uncommonly severe.</p>

<p>"They commenced in this way," (the major threw
himself into attitude.)</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"The other day to Uxbridge town&mdash;<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>"You recollect the circumstance&mdash;I was at Uxbridge&mdash;young
and foolish&mdash;had made the acquaintance
of the Porters (remember the name)&mdash;young
lieutenant was attentive to Miss Porter (lively girl
was Mary Jane); poor, second son, not agreeable to
old people, who, as I told you, called on me to settle
the matter. So I wrote the lines&mdash;terribly sarcastic:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"The other day to Uxbridge town&mdash;<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>now you're coming to it&mdash;</p>

<p>"A major (he was lieutenant, you know) of dragoons

is on a hill). It was a very sarcastic thing, you see.</p>

<p>You remember the name&mdash;Porter, and how I was at
Uxbridge, situated on a hill, was Captain M'Gowd,
then&mdash;young lieutenant, &amp;c., devilish severe verses&mdash;but

<h2>Editor's Drawer.</h2>


<p>The readers of the "Drawer" will be amused
with a forcible picture, which we find in our
collection, of the ups-and-downs of a strolling player's
life. One would think such things enough to
deter young men and women from entering upon so
thorny a profession. "In one of the writer's professional
excursions," runs our extract, "his manager
finds himself in a woeful predicament. His pieces
will not 'draw' in the quiet New England village
where he had temporarily 'set up shop;' he and his
company are literally starving; the men moodily
pacing the stage; the women, who had kept up their
spirits to the last, sitting silent and sorrowful; and
the children, little sufferers! actually crying for food.</p>

<p>"I saw all this," says the manager, "and I began
to feel very suicidal. It was night, and I looked
about for a rope. At length I spied just what I
wanted. A rope dangled at the prompt-side, and
near a steep flight of stairs which led to a dressing
room. '<i>That's</i> it!' said I, with gloomy satisfaction:
'I'll mount those stairs, noose myself, and drop
quietly off in the night; but first let me see whether
it is firmly fastened or no.'</p>

<p>"I accordingly approached, gave a pull at the
rope, when '<i>whish! whish!</i>' I found I had set the
rain a-going. And now a thought struck me. I
leaped, danced, and shouted madly for joy.</p>

<p>"'Where did you get your liquor from?' shouted
the 'walking-gentleman' of the company.</p>

<p>"'He's gone mad!' said Mrs. &mdash;&mdash;, principal lady-actress
of the corps. 'Poor fellow!&mdash;hunger has
made him a maniac. Heaven shield <i>us</i> from a like fate!'</p>

<p>"'Hunger!' shouted I, 'we shall be hungry no
more! Here's food from above (which was <i>literally</i>
true), manna in the wilderness, and all that sort of
thing. We'll feed on rain; we'll feed on rain!'</p>

<p>"I seized a hatchet, and mounting by a ladder,
soon brought the rain-box tumbling to the ground.</p>

<p>"My meaning was now understood. An end of
the box was pried off, and full a bushel of dried
beans and peas were poured out, to the delight of all.
Some were stewed immediately, and although rather
hard, I never relished any thing more. But while
the operation of cooking was going on below, we
amused ourselves with parching some beans upon
the sheet-iron&mdash;the 'thunder' of the theatre&mdash;set
over an old furnace, and heated by rosin from the
lightning-bellows.</p>

<p>"So we fed upon rain, cooked by thunder-and-lightning!"</p>

<p>There is nothing in the history of <span class="smcap">Irving's</span>
"Strolling Player" more characteristic of his class
than the foregoing; and there is a <i>verisimilitude</i> about
the story which does not permit us to doubt its authenticity.
It is too natural <i>not</i> to be true.</p>

<hr />

<p>Think of a patent-medicine vender rising at the
head of his table, where were assembled some score
or two of his customers, and proposing such a toast
as the following:</p>

<p>"Gentlemen: allow me to propose you a sentiment.
When I mention <i>Health</i>, you will all admit
that I allude to the greatest of sublunary blessings.
I am sure then that you will agree with me that we
are all more or less interested in the toast that I am
about to prescribe. I give you, gentlemen,</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Physic</span>, and much good may it do us!"</p>

<p>This sentiment is "drunk with all the honors,"
when a professional Gallenic vocalist favors the
company with the annexed song:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"A <span class="smcap">bumper</span> of Febrifuge fill, fill for me,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Give those who prefer it, Black Draught;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But whatever the dose a strong one it must be,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Though our last dose to-night shall be quaffed.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And while influenza attacks high and low,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And man's queerest feelings oppress him,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Mouth-making, nose-holding, round, round let I go,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Drink our Physic and Founder&mdash;ugh, bless him."<br /></span>

<p>The reader may have heard a good deal from the

<p>Somewhat curious, if true, is an anecdote which
is declared to be authentic, and which we find among
the <i>disjecta membra</i> of our <i>ollapodrida</i>:</p>

<p>Lieutenant Montgomery had seen much military
service. The wars, however, were over; and he
had nothing in the world to do but to lounge about,
as best he could, on his half-pay. One day he was
"taking his ease in his inn," when he observed a
stranger, who was evidently a foreigner, gazing intently
at him. The lieutenant appeared not to notice
him, but shifted his position. After a short time the
stranger shifted <i>his</i> position also, and still stared
with unblemished, unabated gaze.</p>

<p>This was too much for Montgomery. He rose,
and approaching his scrutinizing intruder, said:</p>

<p>"Do you <i>know</i> me, sir?"</p>

<p>"I think I do," answered the foreigner. (He was
a Frenchman.)</p>

<p>"Have we ever met before?" continued Montgomery.</p>

<p>"I will not swear for it; but if we have&mdash;and I
am almost <i>sure</i> we have," said the stranger, "you
have a sabre-cut, a deep one, on your right wrist."</p>

<p>"I have," said Montgomery, turning back his
sleeve, and displaying a very broad and ugly scar.
"I didn't get this for nothing, for the brave fellow
who made me a present of it I repaid with a gash
across the skull!"</p>

<p>The Frenchman bent down his head, parted his
hair with his hands, and said:</p>

<p>"You did: you may look at the receipt."</p>

<p>The next moment they were in each other's arms.</p>

<p>Now this story <i>seems</i> a little problematical; and
yet it is vouched for on what ought to be considered
reliable authority. In short, it is <i>true</i> in every respect.</p>

<hr />

<p>Some ambitious juvenile once sung, with an aspiration
"peculiar to our institutions,"</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"I wish I was the President<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Of these United States,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I never would do nothing<br /></span>
<span class="i1">But swing on all the gates."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>He little knew the miseries, the ennui, the mental
dyspepsia, which afflicts the wretch who has nothing
to do. One of these unhappy mortals it is, who says,
in the bitterness of his spirit:</p>

<p>"Sir, I have no books, and no internal resources.
I can not draw, and if I could, there's nothing that
I want to sketch. I don't play the flute, and if I did
there's nobody that I should like to have listen to
me. I never wrote a tragedy, but I think I am in
that state of mind in which tragedies are written.
Any thing lighter is out of the question. I whistle
four hours a day, yawn five, smoke six, and sleep
the rest of the twenty-four, with a running accompaniment
of swearing to all these occupations except
the last, and I'm not quite sure that I don't sometimes
swear in my dreams.</p>

<p>"In one word, sir, I'm getting desperate, for the
want of <i>something to do</i>."</p>

<hr />

<p>There is a good deal of humor in the sudden
contrast of sentiment and language exhibited in the
verses below. They purport to be the tragi-comical
tale of a deserted sailor-wife, who, with a baby in
her arms, comes often to a rock that overlooks the
main, to catch, if possible, a glimpse of a returning
sail. At length, in despair, she throws her infant
into the sea:</p>

</div></div>

<p>What somebody of the transcendental school of
these latter days calls the "element of unexpectedness,"
is very forcibly exemplified by the writer from
whom we have quoted.</p>

<hr />

<p>We have often laughed over the following scene,
but couldn't tell where it is recorded to save our reputation
for "general knowledge." All that we <i>do</i>
know is, that it is a clever sketch by a clever writer<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_849" id="Page_849">[Pg 849]</a></span>
<i>whoever</i> he may be. The scene is a military station;
and it should be premised that a certain surly, ill-tempered
major, whose wife and sister are in the
habit of visiting him at the barracks, gives orders,
out of spite to subordinate officers, whose families
have hitherto enjoyed the same privilege, that "no
females are to be allowed in barracks after tattoo,
under any pretense whatever:"</p>

<p>"It so happened that the morning after this announcement
appeared in the order-book, an old lieutenant,
who might have been the major's grandfather,
and whom we used to call "The General," on account
of his age and gray hairs, was the officer on
duty. To the sergeant of the guard "the General"
gave the necessary orders, with strict injunctions to
have them obeyed to the letter.</p>

<p>"Shortly after tattoo, sundry ladies, as usual, presented
themselves at the barrack-gate, and were, of
course, refused admission; when, to the surprise of
the sentinel on duty, the major's lady and sister-in-law
made their appearance, and walked boldly to the
wicket, with the intention of entering as usual. To
their utter astonishment, the sentry refused them permission
to pass. The sergeant was called, but that
worthy was quite as much of a precisian as the ladies,
and his conscience would not permit him to let
them in.</p>

<p>"'Do you know who we are, sir?' asked the
major's lady, with much asperity of voice and manner.</p>

<p>"'Oh, sartingly; I knows your ladyships wery
well.'</p>

<p>"'And pray, what do you mean, sir, by this insolence?'</p>

<p>"'I means no imperance whatsomdever, marm;
but my orders is partickler, to let no female ladies
into this here barracks a'ter tattoo, upon no account
whatever; and I means for to obey my orders without
no mistake.'</p>

<p>"'Then you have the effrontery, do you, to refuse
admittance to the lady of your commanding officer?'
screamed the Honorable Mrs. Snooks.</p>

<p>"'And her sister!' joined in the second lady.</p>

<p>"'Most sartingly, marm,' replied the non-commissioned
officer, with profound gravity: 'I knows my
duty, marm.'</p>

<p>"'Good gracious, what assurance!' exclaimed both
ladies in a breath.</p>

<p>"'No insurance at all, marm: if your ladyships
was princesses, you couldn't come in after tattoo;
my orders is partikler!'</p>

<p>"'Don't you know, stupid, that these orders can
not be intended to apply to <i>us</i>?'</p>

<p>"'I doesn't know nuffin about <i>that</i>, my lady: all I
know is, that orders is <i>orders</i>, and must be obeyed.'</p>

<p>"'Impudence!'</p>

<p>"'Imperance or no imperance, I must do my duty;
and I can tell your ladyships if my superior officers
was for to give me orders not to let in the major himself,
I would be obligated for to keep him off at the
p'int of the bay'net!'</p>

<p>"The officer of the guard was sent for, and the officer
of the guard sent for the orderly-book, which, by
the light of the guard-room lantern, was exhibited to
the ladies by 'the General,' in justification of his
apparent rudeness."</p>

<p>It might, doubtless, have been added, that the effect
of such a lesson upon the major, was of a salutary
nature; for the chalice was commended to his
own lips, which he had prepared for others, in downright
earnest.</p>

<p>These lines, from the pen of a Southern poet, are
very tender and touching. They were printed some
ten years since:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"My little girl sleeps on my arm all night,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And seldom stirs, save when, with playful wile,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I bid her rise and place her lips to mine,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Which in her sleep she does. And sometimes then,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Half-muttered in her slumbers, she affirms<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Her love for me is boundless. And I take<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The little bud and close her in my arms;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Assure her by my action&mdash;for my lips<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yield me no utterance then&mdash;that in my heart<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She is the treasured jewel. Tenderly,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Hour after hour, without desire of sleep,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I watch above that large amount of hope,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Until the stars wane, and the yellow morn<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Walks forth into the night."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<hr />

<p>In the final disposition of his characters, <span class="smcap">Dickens</span>
excels any living author. There is no confusion&mdash;no
infringement of the natural. In "Barnaby Rudge,"
for example, the old lethargic inn-keeper, Willett, retiring
in his dotage, and with his ruling passion strong
upon him, scoring up vast imaginary sums to imaginary
customers, and the lament of the elder Weller
at the death of good old Master Humphrey, are not
only characteristic, they are perfect specimens of
their kind. "And the sweet old creetur," says the
elder Weller "has bolted. Him as had no wice,
and was so free from temper that an infant might ha'
drove 'im, has been took at last with that ere unawoidable
fit of the staggers, as we must all come to,
and gone off his feed forever!" "I see him," continues
the old stage-coach driver, "I see him gettin'
every journey more and more groggy. I says to Samivel,
says I, 'Samivel, my boy, the Gray's a-going at
the knees;' and now my predilection is fatally werified;
and him as I could never do enough to serve
or to show my likin' for, is up the great uniwersal
spout o' natur'!"</p>

<hr />

<p>It is poor Tom Hood, if we have not forgotten,
who describes a species of "Statistical Fellows" as</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i1">&mdash;&mdash;"A prying, spying, inquisitive clan,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who jot down the laboring classes' riches,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">And after poking in pot and pan,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And routing garments in want of stitches,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Have ascertained that a working man<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Wears a pair and a half of average breeches!"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Of this kind was the "Scientific Ass-sociate"
mentioned in the "Table Talk of the late John Boyle."
The Professor is setting forth one of his "various
important matters connected with every-day life."
The learned gentleman spoke of shaving as follows:</p>

<p>"The mode of shaving differs in different individuals.
Some are very close shavers; others are
greater adepts at cutting unpleasant acquaintances
than themselves. It is, however, most important
that the art of shaving should be reduced to a nicety,
so that a man can cut his beard with the same facility
as he could cut his stick. It is also of consequence
that an accurate calculation should be made
of the number of shaving brushes and the number of
half pounds of soap used in the course of the year
by respectable shavers, for I have observed that some
of them are very badly off for soap. There is also a
very great variation in the price of labor. Some barbers
undertake to shave well for threepence; others
charge a much higher sum. This is probably the effect
of competition; and I must say, that the Government
deserves well of the country for not encouraging
any monopoly. At the same time there is a looseness
in the details of the profession, which I should
like to see corrected. An accurate register ought to be
kept of the number of individuals who shave themselves,
and of those who shave daily, every other<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_850" id="Page_850">[Pg 850]</a></span>
day, and once a week only. We can hardly contemplate
the immense benefits which science would
reap, if such matters as these were properly attended
to!"</p>

<p>Who has not seen just such statistics as these
dwelt upon with unction by your thorough "statist?"</p>

<hr />

<p>Never forget this "<i>Receipt of Domestic Economy</i>."
When you have paid a bill, always <i>take</i>, and <i>keep</i>, a
receipt of the same:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"O, fling not the receipt away,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Given by one who trusted thee;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Mistakes will happen every day.<br /></span>
<span class="i1">However honest folks may be;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And sad it is, oh, <i>twice</i> to pay,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So cast not thy receipt away!<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza"><br />
<span class="i0">"Ah, yes; if e'er in future hours,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">When we this bill have all forgot,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They send it in <i>again</i>! ye powers!<br /></span>
<span class="i1">And swear that we have paid it not;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">How sweet to know, on such a day,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">We've never cast receipts away!"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<hr />

<p>The following is one of the pen-and-ink portraits
that have found their way into the "Drawer." The
sitter was a subject of our own Gotham.</p>

<p>"He was a Scotchman by birth, and had, without
exception, the ugliest face I ever saw on a man's
shoulders, or a monkey's either, for that matter. But
by a perversity of taste, not unusual in the world,
the man made a complete hobby of his 'mug,' homely
as it was; and was full of the conceit that on fit occasions
he could summon to it a look of terrible and
dignified sarcasm, that was more efficacious than
words or blows. He was rather insolent in his deportment,
and was consequently continually getting
into scrapes with some one or other, in which he invariably
got the worst of it; because instead of lifting
his hand, and giving blow for blow, he always
trusted to the efficacy of his <i>look</i>. His various little
mishaps he used to relate to his fellow-boarders at
meal-times, always concluding his narrations with,
'But didn't I give the dirty rapscallions one o' my
<i>looks</i>?' And then twisting his 'ugly mug' into a
shape impossible to be described, he fancied he had
convinced his hearers that his antagonists, whoever
they were, would be in no hurry to meddle with <i>him</i>
again!</p>

<p>"The last time I saw him, he was giving an account
of an insult he had received the night before
at some porter-house in the neighborhood, where a
little fellow, who was a perfect stranger to him, had
insisted upon drinking at his expense, and who,
when he refused to pay for the liquor, had not only
abused him most shamefully with his tongue, but
had actually <i>kicked</i> him.</p>

<p>"'Kick you!' exclaimed a fellow-boarder.</p>

<p>"'Yes!' said he, growing warm with the recital;
'he kicked me here!' and he laid his hand on that
portion of his valorous person that had come in contact
with the stranger's boot.</p>

<p>"'And what did you say to <i>that</i>?' asked a second
listener.</p>

<p>"'What did I <i>say</i> to it?' he replied, as if astonished
that any body should be ignorant of his invariable
rejoinder to similar assaults. 'What did I <i>say</i>? I
said nothing at all. The kick was but a soft one,
and the fellow that gave it a wee bit of a 'jink-ma-doddy,'
that I could have throttled with one hand on
the spot. But I just contented myself with giving
him one of my looks!'</p>

<p>"Here Sawney 'defined his position' to the company,
by giving them one of his awful glances. But
<i>this</i> time he managed to convey an expression of
ugliness and comicality so far beyond any thing he
had ever called up before, that the inference was
irresistible that the kick he had received must have
been a good deal harder than he was willing to acknowledge."</p>

<hr />

<p>Any man or woman walking up or down the sunny
side of Broadway, on a pleasant summer day, will
see various little bipeds, with thin legs, faded countenances,
and jaded air, flourishing little canes, who
may, perhaps, bring to mind the following lines:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Some say there's nothing made in vain,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">While others the reverse maintain,<br /></span>
<span class="i8">And prove it, very handy,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">By citing animals like these&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Musquitoes, bed-bugs, crickets, fleas,<br /></span>
<span class="i8">And, worse than all&mdash;<span class="smcap">a dandy</span>!"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>But Nature, as the poet adds, "never made a
dandy;" he was cast in a fictitious mould altogether.</p>

<hr />

<p>There is something not over-complimentary to us,
magazine-editors, in the remonstrance which "Chawls
Yellowplush" makes to his employer against his discharging
him from his employ, because he has ascertained
that he writes in magazines, and other periodicals:</p>

<p>"'Sir,' says I, claspink my 'ands, and bursting
into tears, 'do not, for Eving's sake, do not think of
anythink of the sort, or drive me from your service,
because I have been fool enough to write in magazeens!
Glans but one moment at your honor's
plate; every spoon is as bright as a mirror; condescend
to igsamine your shoos; your honor may see
reflected in them the faces of every one in the company.
If occasionally I've forgot the footman in the
lit'ry man, and committed to paper my remindicences
of fashionable life, it was from a sinsear desire
to do good and promote nollitch; and I apeal to your
honor&mdash;I lay my hand on my busm, and in the face
of this honorable company, beg you to say&mdash;when
you rung your bell, who came to you first? When
you stopt out till mornink, who sat up for you?
When you was ill, who forgot the nat'ral dignities
of his station, and answered the two-pair bell? Oh,
sir,' says I, 'I knows what's what: don't send me
away! I know them lit'ry chaps, and, bleave me,
I'd rather be a footman. The work is not so hard&mdash;the
pay is better&mdash;the vittels incompyrably shuperiour.
I've but to clean my things, run my errints,
you put clothes on my back, and meat in my mouth.'"</p>

<p>This was written by one who was himself, in his
own person, an admirable illustration of what success
and honor a <i>true</i> literary man is capable of achieving;
but Yellowplush's "lit'ry men" were of a different
calibre.</p>

<hr />

<p>The learned "science-women" of the day, the
"deep, deep-blue stockings" of the time, are fairly
hit off in the ensuing satirical sonnet:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">I idolize the <span class="smcap">Ladies</span>! They are fairies,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That spiritualize this world of ours;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From heavenly hot-beds most delightful flowers,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or choice cream-cheeses from celestial dairies,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But learning, in its barbarous seminaries,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Gives the dear creatures many wretched hours,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And on their gossamer intellect sternly showers<br /></span>
<span class="i0"><span class="smcap">Science</span>, with all its horrid accessaries.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Now, seriously, the only things, I think,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In which young ladies should instructed be,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Are&mdash;stocking-mending, love, and cookery!&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Accomplishments that very soon will sink,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Since Fluxions now, and Sanscrit conversation,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Always form part of female education!<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Something good in the way of inculcation may be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_851" id="Page_851">[Pg 851]</a></span>
educed from this rather biting sonnet. If woman so
far forgets her "mission," as it is common to term it
nowadays, as to choose those accomplishments whose
only recommendation is that they are "the vogue," in
preference to acquisitions which will fit her to be a
better wife and mother, she becomes a fair subject for
the shafts of the satirical censor.</p>

<hr />

<p>The following bit of gossip is especially "Frenchy,"
and will remind the readers of "The Drawer" of the
man described by the late <span class="smcap">Robert C. Sands</span>, who
sued for damages in a case of breach-of-promise of
marriage. He was offered two hundred dollars to
heal his breaking heart. "Two hundred dollars!"
he exclaimed; "two hundred dollars for ruined hopes&mdash;for
blighted affection&mdash;for a wretched existence&mdash;a
blasted life! Two hundred dollars! for all this!!
No&mdash;never! <i>Make it three hundred, and it's a bargain!</i>"
But to the French story:</p>

<p>"A couple very well known in Paris are at present
arranging terms of separation, to avoid the scandal
of a judicial divorce. A friend has been employed
by the husband to negotiate the matter. The latest
mission was in relation to a valuable ring given to the
husband by one of the then sovereigns of Europe, and
which he wished to retain. For this he would make
a certain much-desired concession, The friend made
the demand&mdash;</p>

<p>"What!" said the indignant wife, "do you venture
to charge yourself with such a mission to <i>me</i>!
Can you believe that I could tear myself from a gift
which alone recalls to me the day when my husband
loved me? No: this ring is my only <i>souvenir</i> of a
happiness, now, alas! forever departed! 'Tis all
that I now possess of a once-fond husband!"</p>

<p>Here she threw herself upon a <i>fauteuil</i>, and covered
her face with her hands.</p>

<p>But the husband's friend insisted. The lady supplicated&mdash;grew
desperate&mdash;threatened to submit to a
public divorce, as a lesser evil than parting with that
cherished ring&mdash;and at last confessed that she had&mdash;<i>sold
the ring six months before!</i></p>

<p>Wasn't <i>that</i> a climax?</p>

<hr />

<p>A very quaint and pretty scrap of verse is this,
from the old German:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Should you meet my true love,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Say, I greet her well;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Should she ask you how I fare,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Say, she best can tell.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza"><br />
<span class="i0">"Should she ask if I am sick,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Say, I died of sorrow;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Should she then begin to weep,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Say, I'll come to-morrow!"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<hr />

<p>It has been thought strange, that when a malefactor
is executed at "<i>The Tombs</i>," that curiosity
should be excited to know how the unfortunate
wretch behaved at the last, and at the same time
great anxiety is manifested to obtain the slightest
relic connected with his ignominious death. This
propensity is well hit off in the following episode in
the life of "<i>A Criminal Curiosity-Hunter</i>." A friend
visits him, and he thus describes the interview:</p>

<p>"He received me with extreme urbanity, and
asked me to sit down in an old-fashioned arm-chair.
I did so.</p>

<p>"'I suppose, sir,' said he, with an air of suppressed
triumph, 'that you have no idea that you are
now sitting in a very remarkable chair!'</p>

<p>"I assured him that I was totally unconscious of
the fact.</p>

<p>"'Let me tell you, then,' said he, 'that it was in
that chair that Fauntleroy, the banker, who was hanged
for forgery, was sitting when he was arrested!'</p>

<p>"'Indeed!'</p>

<p>"'Fact, sir! I gave ten guineas for it! I thought,
also, to have obtained the night-cap in which he slept
the night before his execution, but another collector
was beforehand with me, and bribed the turnkey to
steal it for him.'</p>

<p>"'I had no idea,' I said, 'that there could be any
competition for such an article.'</p>

<p>"'Ah, sir!' said he, with a deep sigh, 'you don't
know the value of these interesting relics. I have
been upward of thirty years a collector of them.
When a man devotes himself to a great object, he
must go to it heart and soul. I have spared neither
time nor money in <i>my</i> pursuit; and since I became
a collector I have attended the execution of every
noted malefactor throughout the kingdom.'</p>

<p>"Perceiving that my attention was drawn to a
common rope which served as a bell-pull, he said to
me:</p>

<p>"'I see you are remarking my bell-cord; that is
the identical rope, sir, which hanged Bellingham,
who murdered Mr. Perceval in the House of Commons.
I offered any sum for the one in which
Thistlewood ended his life, to match it, but I was
disappointed.... The Whigs, sir, have swept away
all our good old English customs, and deprived us
of our national recreations. I remember, sir, when
Monday was called 'hanging-day' at the Old Bailey;
on that morning a man might be certain of
seeing three or four criminals swung off before
breakfast.'"</p>

<p>The criminal curiosity-hunter now takes his friend
into an adjoining room, where he shows him his
general museum of curiosities, comprising relics of
every grade of crime, from murder to petty larceny;
among them a door-mat made of oakum picked by a
"lady"-culprit while in the penitentiary; a short
clay-pipe, once in the possession of Burke, the
wholesale murderer; and the <i>fork</i> belonging to the
<i>knife</i> with which some German had cut his wife's
and children's throats!</p>

<hr />

<p>"Misery," it is said, "loves company." What
a juvenile "company," when the last thaw came&mdash;(and
so many came, after what was supposed to be
the <i>last</i> snow, this season, that it would be difficult
to count them)&mdash;what a juvenile company, we say,
there was, to lament with the skate-vender who
poured out his griefs in the following affecting parody
upon the late <span class="smcap">Thomas Moore's</span> lines, "I never
loved a dear gazelle," &amp;c.:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"I never wrote up 'Skates to sell,'<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Trusting to fickle Nature's law,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But&mdash;when I advertised them well,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">And puffed them&mdash;it was sure to thaw.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yes; it was ever thus&mdash;the Fates<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Seem adverse to the trade in skates.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza"><br />
<span class="i0">"If a large lot I chanced to buy,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Thinking 'twas likely <i>still</i> to freeze<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Up the thermometer would fly,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">All in a day, some ten degrees.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Their presence in my window-pane,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Turns ice to mud, and snow to rain."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>But, after all, our skate-vender has no great need
of fear. We have had deep snows in April, and May
<i>may</i> bring him his season yet: for what says the
Almanac of past years? Why, that</p>

<h2>Literary Notices.</h2>


<p><i>Austria in 1848 and '49</i>, by <span class="smcap">W.H. Stiles</span> (Harper
and Brothers). This work, in two octavo volumes,
by the late Charg&eacute; d'Affaires of the United States, at
the Court of Vienna, furnishes the most complete history
that has yet appeared of the political affairs of
Hungary, with ample and accurate details of the late
disastrous revolutionary struggle. From his diplomatic
position at Vienna, Mr. Stiles had rare opportunities
for observation, of which he has availed himself in
a manner that is highly creditable to his acuteness
and good sense. He has evidently made a diligent
study of his subject in all its bearings; the best
authorities have been faithfully consulted; conflicting
views have been cautiously weighed; but his
final conclusions are derived from the free exercise
of his own judgment. Hence his work is quite free
from the spirit of partisanship. It is critical in its
tone, rather than dogmatic. Aiming at entire impartiality,
it may seem too moderate in its statements
to satisfy the advocates of extreme views on either
side. Mr. Stiles shows an ardent attachment to the
principles of liberty; he is thoroughly imbued with
the spirit of American institutions; but he has no
sympathy with the Communism or Red Republicanism
of Europe. An admirer of the heroic enthusiasm
of Kossuth, he displays no wish to conceal the defects
of his character. He is opposed, with strong conviction,
to the interference of America in the affairs of
Hungary. At the same time he deprecates the tyranny
of which she has been the victim, and presents
a candid and intelligent view of the nature of her
recent struggle. His volume contains many felicitous
portraitures of the leading actors on both sides. A
number of valuable and interesting documents, illustrative
of the Revolutionary movement, are preserved
in the Appendix.</p>

<p>The following description of the Seress&acirc;ners, a
portion of Jellachich's troops, presents a favorable
specimen of the picturesque style in which the author
often temperately indulges:</p>

<p>"<i>Seress&acirc;ners</i> are the wild border soldiers from
Montenegro, and bearing a stronger resemblance to
the Indians of the North American forests than to
the ordinary troops of the European continent. The
frame of such a borderer seems to be nothing but
sinew and muscle; and with ease, nay, without appearing
to be at all affected by them, he endures
hardships and fatigues to which the most seasoned
soldiers are scarcely equal. A piece of oaten bread
and a dram of <i>sklikowitz</i> (plum brandy) suffice him,
on an emergency, a whole day, and with that refreshment
alone will march on untired, alike in the most
scorching heat and the most furious snow-storm; and
when night comes, he desires no other couch than
the bare ground, no other roof than the open sky.
Their costume is most peculiar, as well as picturesque.
There is something half Albanian in
some portions of the dress&mdash;in the leggings and full
trowsers fastened at the knee, and in the heavily
gold-embroidered crimson jacket. But that which
gives decided character and striking originality to
these sons of war is the cloak. Over these giant
frames hangs a mantle of scarlet cloth, fastened
tightly at the throat; below this, on the breast, depends
the clasp of the jacket, a large silver egg, made
so as to open and serve as a cup. In the loose girdle
are to be seen the richly-mounted pistols and glittering
kandjar&mdash;Turkish arms chiefly; for every <i>Seress&acirc;ner</i>
is held, by old tradition, to have won his first
weapon from the Turk. The mantle has a cape, cut
somewhat in the shape of a bat's wing, but which,
joined together by hooks and eyes, forms a sharp
pointed hood, resembling those of the Venetian <i>marinari</i>,
but higher and more peaked. Over the crimson
cap, confined by a gold band upon the brow, falling
with a gold tassel on the shoulder, rises this red
hood, usually overshadowing such a countenance as
a Murillo or a Vandyke would delight to portray.
The brilliant rays of the long dark eye repose beneath
a thick fringe of sable lashes; but you feel
that, if awakened, they must flash forth in fire. The
brow, the mouth, and the nose are all essentially
noble features; and over all is spread a skin of such
clear olive-brown, that you are inclined to think you
have a Bedouin before you."</p>

<p>Our readers will remember the controversy which
has recently produced some excitement in London,
with regard to a person claiming to be a Hungarian
baroness, employed in the political service of Kossuth.
The following curious anecdote sets that
question at rest, while it explains the romantic manner
in which Mr. Stiles was put in possession of the
dispatch from Kossuth, requesting his intervention
with the Imperial Government:</p>

<p>"On the night of the 2d December, 1848, when
all communication between Hungary and Austria
had ceased, large armies on either side guarding
their respective frontiers, the author was seated in
the office of the Legation of the United States at
Vienna, when his servant introduced a young female,
who desired, as she said, to see him at once upon
urgent business. She was a most beautiful and
graceful creature, and, though attired in the dress of
a peasant, the grace and elegance of her manner, the
fluency and correctness of her French, at once denoted
that she was nearer a princess than a peasant.
She sat and conversed for some time before she ventured
to communicate the object of her visit. As
soon as the author perceived that in the exercise of
the utmost caution she desired only to convince herself
that she was not in error as to the individual she
sought, he told her that, upon the honor of a gentle
man, she might rest assured that the individual she
saw before her was the diplomatic agent of the
United States at the court of Vienna. Upon that
assurance, she immediately said, 'Then, sir, I am
the bearer of a communication to you.' She then
asked, 'Have you a servant, sir, in whom you can
rely, who can go with me into the street for a few
moments?' The author replied that he had no servant
in whom he could rely, that he feared they were
all in the pay of the police, but that he had a private
secretary in whom he reposed confidence, and who
could accompany her. The secretary was immediately
called, they descended together into the street,
and in a few moments returned, bearing with them
the rack of a wagon. This rack, which is a fixture
attached either to the fore or back part of a peasant's
wagon, and intended to hold hay for the horses during
a journey, was composed of small slats, about two
inches wide and about the eighth of an inch thick,
crossing each other at equal distances, constituted a
semicircular net-work. As all these slats, wherever
they crossed, were fastened together with either wooden
or iron bolts, with our unskillful hands an hour
nearly was consumed before we could get the rack in
pieces. When this was accomplished, we saw nothing
before us but a pile of slats; but the fair courier, taking
them up one by one, and examining them very
minutely, at length selected a piece, exclaiming,
'This is it!' The slat selected resembled the others
so completely, that the most rigid observer, unapprised<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_853" id="Page_853">[Pg 853]</a></span>
of the fact, could not have detected the slightest difference
between them; but, by the aid of a penknife,
to separate its parts, this slat was found to be composed
of two pieces, hollowed out in the middle, and
affording space enough to hold a folded letter. In
this space had been conveyed, with a secrecy which
enabled it to pass the severe scrutiny of the Austrian
sentinels, the communication addressed to the author
by Louis Kossuth.</p>

<p>"The mysterious personage, as intrepid as she
was fair, who undertook the conveyance of this dispatch,
at night, alone and unprotected, in an open
peasant's wagon, in a dreadful snow-storm, through
the midst of the Austrian army, when detection
would have been certain death, was (as M. Pulszky
has just informed the author) then a single lady, has
since married, and is now the Countess Motesiczky.</p>

<p>"The statement, therefore, of a person assuming
the title of Baroness de Beck, and who, in a work
upon the Hungarian war, published in England about
two years ago, claiming for herself the credit of having
been the bearer of the dispatch referred to, is altogether
without foundation. This authoress, whose
character, as well as untimely and remarkable death,
was involved in so much mystery, and excited for a
time so much discussion in Europe, was (as M.
Pulszky represents) the servant of the Countess Motesiczky,
and thus became possessed of a knowledge
of the incident above detailed."</p>

<p>Stringer and Townsend have issued the fourth
edition of <i>Frank Forester's Field Sports of the United
States</i>, by <span class="smcap">Henry William Herbert</span>, with several
additions and new pictorial illustrations. One need
not be a practical sportsman in order to enjoy, with
keen zest, the racy descriptions of silvan life which
flow so charmingly from the practiced pen of this accomplished
"Forester." In the woods, he is every
where at home. He not only knows how to bag his
game, but he studies all their habits as a book, and
never leaves them till they have fulfilled their destiny
on the table of the epicure. Writing, in a great
measure, from personal experience, his style has all
the freshness of a mountain breeze. With a quick
eye for the picturesque, he paints the scenery of our
American sporting grounds, with admirable truthfulness
and spirit. He has made free use in these volumes
of the works of distinguished naturalists, Audubon,
Giraud, Wilson, Godman and others, and has
been equally happy in his borrowings and in his own
productions. We recommend his manual to all who
cherish a taste for rural life. To sportsmen, of
course, we need say nothing of its merits.</p>

<p>The <i>Golden Christmas</i>, by <span class="smcap">W. Gilmore Simms</span> is
the title of a slight story, presenting many vivid
sketches of social life on a Southern plantation. In
its execution, it is more careless than the usual
writings of the author, but its ease and vivacity will
make it a favorite with indulgent readers in search
merely of amusement. Its prevailing tone is "genial
and gentle, tender and tolerant, not strategetical and
tragical." (Published by Walker, Richards, and Co.
Charleston, S.C.)</p>

<p><i>Falkenburgh</i> is a recent novel by the author of "Mildred
Vernon," which is well worth reading, for its
piquant delineations of character, apart from the current
interest of the plot, which is one of great power
and intensity. The scene is laid in the picturesque
regions of the Rhine, and suggests many delightful
pictures to the rare descriptive talents of the writer.
(Harper and Brothers.)</p>


<p>A new work of fiction by <span class="smcap">Caroline Chesebro</span>,
entitled <i>Isa, A Pilgrimage</i>, is issued by J.S. Redfield,
in the style of simple elegance which distinguishes
his recent publications. This is a more ambitious
effort than the former productions of the authoress,
displaying a deeper power of reflection, a
greater intensity of passion, and a more complete
mastery of terse and pointed expression. On the
whole, we regard it as a successful specimen of a
quite difficult species of composition. Without the
aid of a variety of incident or character, with scarcely
a sufficient number of events to give a fluent movement
to the plot, and with very inconsiderable reference
to external nature, the story turns on the development
of an abnormal spiritual experience, showing
the perils of entire freedom of thought in a powerful,
original mind, during the state of intellectual
transition between attachment to tradition and the
supremacy of individual conviction. The scene is
laid in the interior world&mdash;the world of consciousness,
of reflection, of passion. In this twilight region,
so often peopled with monstrous shapes, and
spectral phantasms, the author treads with great
firmness of step. With rare subtlety of discrimination,
she brings hidden springs of action to light, untwisting
the tangled webs of experience, and revealing
with painful minuteness, some of the darkest and
most fearful depths of the human heart. The characters
of Isa and Stuart, the leading personages of
the story, certainly display uncommon insight and
originality. They stand out from the canvas in
gloomy, portentous distinctness, with barely light
enough thrown upon them to enable us to recognize
their weird, mysterious features. For our own part,
we should prefer to meet this writer, whose rare gifts
we cordially acknowledge, in a more sunny atmosphere;
but we are bound to do justice to the depth
and vigor of the present too sombre creation.</p>

<p><i>The Howadji in Syria</i>, by <span class="smcap">George W. Curtis</span>
(Harper and Brothers). Another fragrant record of
Oriental life by the delightful pen which dropped
spices and honey so luxuriantly in the unmatched
<i>Nile Notes of a Howadji</i>. This volume is written in
a more subdued strain&mdash;the radiant Oriental splendors
gleam less dazzlingly, as the traveler approaches
the West&mdash;the pictures of gorgeous beauty are softened
down to a milder tone&mdash;and as the pinnacles
of the Holy City appear in view, a "dim religious
light" tempers the glowing imaginative sensuosity
which revels in the glorious enchantments of the
sunny Nile. As a descriptive writer, the Howadji
has few equals in modern literature. He is indebted
for his success to his exquisite perceptions of external
nature, combined with a fancy fertile in charming
images, and a vein of subtle reflection, which often
gives an unexpected depth to his pictures, in the
midst of what may at first seem to be only the flashes
of a brilliant rainbow coloring. His notices of facts
have the accuracy of a gazetteer. They are sharp,
firm, well-defined, and singularly expressive. The
most prosaic writer could not give a more faithful
daguerreotype copy of Eastern scenery. Read his
account of the Camel, in the description of his passage
across the Desert from Cairo to Jerusalem. The
ugly beast is made as familiar to the eye as the horses
in a Broadway omnibus. A few authentic touches
give a more vivid impression of this unwieldy "ship of
the desert" than the labored details of natural history.
But this fidelity to nature is by no means the ultimate
aim of the Howadji. It is only the condition of
a higher sweep. It serves as the foundation of a
series of delicious prose poems, sparkling with beauty,
electric with emotion, and seductive to the ear by
their liquid melody of expression. The Howadji is
no less loyal to feeling than he is faithful to nature.
With not the faintest trace of sentimentalism, he is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_854" id="Page_854">[Pg 854]</a></span>
not ashamed of the eye and the soul susceptible to
all beautiful influences. He writes out his experience
with a cordial frankness that disarms prejudice.
This union of imagination and fact in the writings of
the Howadji must always give a charm to his personal
narratives. No one can listen to the relation
of his unique adventures without delight. How far
his admirable success in this line of composition
would insure his success in a purely imaginative
work, we do not venture to predict. We trust he
will yet give us an opportunity to decide the experiment.</p>

<p><i>A Commentary on the Book of Proverbs</i>, by <span class="smcap">Moses
Stuart</span>. In a characteristic Preface to this volume,
which is the last that came from the press previous
to the lamented death of the author, Professor Stuart
maintains that the Book of Proverbs was not wholly
composed by Solomon, but that it consists of a selection
of the proverbial sayings that were current among
the wise men of the Hebrew nation. These were
digested and arranged by Solomon, and received his
sanction by passing through his hands. Most of the
maxims are the offspring of sound common sense, of
much experience, and of acute discrimination. They
present a vivid picture of the internal Hebrew man&mdash;of
his genius, feelings, morals, industry, social
condition, and, indeed, of the whole state of the Hebrews,
and their rank among the society of nations.
The commentary by Professor Stuart is adapted to
beginners in the Hebrew study, giving minute attention
to all the philological difficulties, whether in
form, idiom, or syntax. It exhibits a profusion of
grammatical and exegetical learning, a devoted study
of the original text, and considerable analytic acumen.

<p><i>The Story of a Soul</i>, by <span class="smcap">Henry W. Parker</span>, is
the title of an anniversary Poem, read before a literary
society of Hamilton College, devoted to a retrospect
of the supposed experience of a soul, and of the
progress of society during the nineteenth century.
It shows a lively imagination, a familiar acquaintance
with human nature, and an uncommon fluency
of expression. The alternation in the poem of grave
reflections on the spiritual life, and touches of sarcastic
humor on the current events of the day, gives
a lively air to the composition, and well sustains the
interest of the reader. (Sold by Evans and Brittan.)</p>

<p>Lippincott, Grambo, and Co. have commenced the
publication of a series of <i>Cabinet Histories</i>, embracing
a volume for each State in the Union. The
work is intrusted to the charge of <span class="smcap">T.S. Arthur</span>,
and <span class="smcap">W.H. Carpenter</span>, whose names may be taken
as a guarantee that their task will be performed with
exactness and fidelity, and that no sectarian, sectional,
or party feelings will bias their judgment, or lead
them to violate the integrity of history. It is intended
to present a brief narrative of the domestic policy
of each State; and, at the same time, to give a peculiar
prominence to the personal history of the people,
illustrating the progressive development of the
social state from the rude forest life of the earlier
day to the present condition of refinement and prosperity.
The design of the series is excellent. If
ably carried out, as we have no doubt it will be, it
must prove an important contribution to the interests
of popular education. We have already received the
<i>Histories of Kentucky</i> and of <i>Georgia</i>, which are executed
in a manner that furnishes the highest promise
for the future volumes of the series. The style
is marked by rare simplicity and clearness. The facts
are well arranged, and apparently based on authentic
evidence. A fine portrait of the veteran pioneer,
Daniel Boone, embellishes the History of Kentucky.</p>

<p>The translation of <span class="smcap">Mosheim's</span> <i>Commentaries on
the State of Christianity before the Age of Constantine</i>,
by <span class="smcap">James Murdock</span>, D.D., is a valuable contribution
to the literature of Ecclesiastical History. This work
is well known to the students of theology as one of
great learning and research, and has not been superseded
by the more elaborate and ambitious productions
of a later period. Dr. Murdock's name is a
sufficient assurance of the fidelity of the translation.
(Published by S. Converse.)</p>

<p>A new edition of Madame <span class="smcap">Pulszky's</span> delightful
<i>Tales and Traditions of Hungary</i> has been issued by
J.S. Redfield. They are full to overflowing of the
genuine Magyar spirit, presenting a series of rich
and beautiful portraitures of the old Hungarian life.
In the prevailing interest which is now attached to
the country of Kossuth, this volume can not fail to
find a welcome reception with the American public.</p>

<p><i>Lays of the Scottish Cavaliers</i>, by <span class="smcap">William Edmondstone
Aytoun</span>. The brave martial spirit of
these poems of the olden time is finely sustained by
the ringing melody of their rhythm. Combining a
fervent admiration of the Cavaliers with a devout
hatred of the Covenanters, the author has embodied
his political feelings in resonant strains. The neat
edition of his volume brought out by Redfield will
make him better known in this country.</p>

<p>Harper and Brothers have published <i>Notes on the
Book of Revelation</i>, by Rev. <span class="smcap">Albert Barnes</span>, forming
the eleventh volume of Barnes's <i>Notes on the New
Testament</i>. The character of this popular commentary
is too well known to require any critical remarks.
In the preface to the present volume, the author makes
some interesting statements with regard to the progress
of the work from its commencement to its completion.
It was begun more than twenty years ago.
It was intended only to comprise brief and simple
Notes on the Gospels, for the use of Bible classes
and Sunday-school teachers. Contrary to the original
plan of the author, his Notes have been extended to
eleven volumes, and embrace the whole of the New
Testament. They have been written entirely in the
early hours of the morning, before nine o'clock, the
rest of the day having been invariably devoted to other
pursuits. In studying the Apocalypse, without any
pre-conceived theory as to its plan, Mr. Barnes discovered
that the series of events recorded by Gibbon
bore a singular correspondence to the series of symbols
made use of by the sacred writer. This fact
presents a point of literary curiosity which we apprehend
has escaped the notice of previous writers. The
remarks upon it by Mr. Barnes are quite to the purpose:
"The symbols were such as it might be supposed
<i>would be used</i>, on the supposition that they were
intended to refer to these events; and the language of
Mr. Gibbon was often such as <i>he would have used</i>, on
the supposition that he had designed to prepare a
commentary on the symbols employed by John. It
was such, in fact, that, if it had been found in a
Christian writer, professedly writing a commentary
on the book of Revelation, it would have been regarded
by infidels as a designed attempt to force history
to utter a language that should conform to a
pre-determined theory in expounding a book full of symbols.
So remarkable have these coincidences appeared
to me in the course of this exposition, that it
has almost seemed as if he had designed to write a
commentary on some portions of this book, and I
have found it difficult to doubt that that distinguished
historian was raised up by an overruling Providence
to make a record of those events which would ever
afterward be regarded as an impartial and unprejudiced
statement of the evidences of the fulfillment of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_855" id="Page_855">[Pg 855]</a></span>
prophecy. The historian of the 'Decline and Fall
of the Roman Empire' had no belief in the divine
origin of Christianity, but he brought to the performance
of his work learning and talent such as few
Christian scholars have possessed. He is always
patient in his investigations; learned and scholar-like
in his references; comprehensive in his groupings,
and sufficiently minute in his details; unbiased in
his statements of facts, and usually cool and candid
in his estimates of the causes of the events which he
records; and, excepting his philosophical speculations,
and his sneers at every thing, he has probably
written the most candid and impartial history of the
times that succeeded the introduction of Christianity,
that the world possesses, and even after all that has
been written since his time, his work contains the
best ecclesiastical history that is to be found. Whatever
use of it can be made in explaining and confirming
the prophecies, will be regarded by the world as
impartial and fair, for it is a result which he least
of all contemplated, that he would ever be regarded
as an expounder of the prophecies in the Bible, or be
referred to as vindicating their truth."</p>

<p><i>Romanism at Home</i>, by <span class="smcap">Kirwan</span>, is a controversial
work against the Roman Catholic Church, in a series
of Letters to the Hon. Chief Justice Taney. Bold,
vehement, and enthusiastic&mdash;of a stringent polemical
tone&mdash;and abounding in striking local and personal
details&mdash;it is adapted to make a strong impression,
and can not fail to be extensively read. (Harper and
Brothers.)</p>

<hr />

<p>Lord <span class="smcap">Cockburn's</span> <i>Life of Francis Jeffrey</i> is welcomed
by the London Press as one of the most charming
books of the season. The Correspondence is
spoken of as being singularly delightful. "The generous
humanity," says the <i>Athen&aelig;um</i>, "the genial
good-will, the ever-recurring play of the noblest affections
of the heart endear to us the writer of these
letters, and claim the sympathies of all who are alive
to what is beautiful in human nature. They exhibit
much of the vivacity and freshness of Walpole, combined
with the literary grace of Chesterfield and the
sweet tenderness of Cowper. In their union of emotional
feeling with refined sense and bright conception,
their character is almost poetical. They are
revelations of Jeffrey's heart as well as of his head,
and will make him known and loved by countless
readers. His fascination as friend and companion
can be easily understood after reading these effusions
of a mind whose genial feeling could not be stifled or
depressed by forensic or literary toil, or by the snows
of age."</p>

<hr />

<p>The ninth and tenth volumes of Mr. <span class="smcap">Grote's</span> <i>History
of Greece</i> are now out. They bring down the
history from the period of the culmination of the
Spartan supremacy, to the accession of Philip of
Macedon. "A very remarkable thing about these
two volumes," says the <i>Leader</i>, "is the amount of
political teaching they contain, adapted to the present
hour. The volumes are, we may say, pervaded with
a lesson of contrast between the results of a government
founded on despotism, and those of a government
founded on free speech. Invariably in Greece,
where free speech was permitted, and democratic
spirit prevailed, the developments of society were
better, greater, and more orderly, than where matters
were managed by long continuations of military despotism,
or occasional <i>coups d'&eacute;tat</i>." Three or four
volumes more will conclude this great work.</p>

<hr />

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Gladstone</span> has published the third volume of
his translation of <span class="smcap">Farini's</span> <i>History of the Roman State</i>.
This volume carries on the story from the flight of
the Pope, to the landing of General Oudinot at
Civita Vecchia. "The narrative is interesting," says
the <i>Leader</i>, "but, like the two previous volumes,
narrow and peevish in its spirit. One regrets more
than ever, on reading these volumes, that <span class="smcap">Margaret
Fuller's</span> <i>History of the Italian Movement</i> has been
lost to the world; it would have told the story of the
Roman Republic in so different a spirit from that of
the crabbed Farini, who, though he writes well
enough, is precisely one of those men who would act
like vinegar in any cause, souring all, and helping
nothing. By-the-by, <span class="smcap">Saffi</span>, Mazzini's young and
gifted colleague in the Triumvirate (one of the few
men of whom even Farini speaks well, and who is
precisely the man to win golden opinions from all
sorts of people, and what is more, to deserve them),
is writing a <i>History of the Roman Revolution of
1848-49</i>. We believe part of it is already written,
if not published by the Italian press of Switzerland."</p>

<hr />

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Moxon</span> has called in the <i>Shelley Papers</i>, in
two volumes, published in January last, it having been
discovered that the whole work was a collection of ingenious
forgeries, deceiving alike publisher, editor,
and public. The first suspicion raised of their genuineness
was by a correspondent of the Literary Gazette
drawing attention to the singular identity of whole
paragraphs of some of the letters, with an article in
the Quarterly on "Fine Arts in Florence" in 1840,
and contemporaneously, Mr. Palgrave discovered the
embodiment of a whole article of his father's, contributed
to the Edinburgh Review. This led to further
examination and strict inquiry, and there appears
at the present time, says the London journals, but
little reason to doubt that the letters which were purchased
at auctions for high prices can be traced to
the "George Gordon Byron, Esq.," whose projected
publication in England, some years since, of some
alleged secret unpublished papers of Lord Byron
was prohibited.</p>

<p>We believe it has not yet been stated, with reference
to these forgeries, that they were made, not to
impose on autograph collectors, for which purpose
their value, in relation to the time and pains spent in
their fabrication, would offer no inducement; but
they were produced to authenticate a new memoir
of Lord Byron, but this publication having failed,
and the author falling into distress, was compelled to
part with his alleged "original MSS."</p>

<hr />

<p>The <i>London Critic</i> says that the Messrs. "Routledge
have presented to the British lovers of poetry
the collected works of <span class="smcap">James Russell Lowell</span>, one
of the foremost in local fame of the poets of America,
but who is less known in England than some of his
brethren of lesser merit. This reprint, at a trifling
price, will, we trust, introduce him to the better acquaintance
of our readers, who can not but be pleased
with the vivid imagination, the fruitful fancy, the
exquisite transcripts of nature, and the lofty sentiment
that pervades his productions."</p>

<hr />

<p>We learn from the <i>Athen&aelig;um</i> that Margaret Fuller,
on the eve of that visit to the Continent which was
to prove so eventful and disastrous, left in the hands
of a friend in London a sealed packet, containing, it
is understood, the journals which she kept during
her stay in England. Margaret Fuller contemplated
at that time a return to England at no very distant
date; and the deposit of these papers was accompanied
by an injunction that the packet should then<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_856" id="Page_856">[Pg 856]</a></span>
be restored with unbroken seal into her own hands.
The papers are likely to be of great interest, and
were doubtless intended for publication; but the writer
had peremptorily reserved the right of revision to
herself, and forbidden the breaking of the seals, on a
supposition which fate has now made impossible.
The equity of the case under such circumstances demands
only a reference to Margaret Fuller's literary
executors.</p>

<hr />

<p>Lord <span class="smcap">John Russell</span> is engaged in the preparation
of a Life of <i>Charles James Fox</i>. The materials, collected
by Lord Holland and by Mr. Allen, have been
long since placed at his lordship's disposal, and the
work might have been ready but for the public duties
which occupy so much of his attention and time.</p>

<hr />

<p>At a recent sale of books in London a few rarities
were brought to the hammer. "The Bokes of Solomon,"
printed by W. Copland, 1551, a very rare little
volume, sold for 26<i>l.</i>; a copy of Coverdale's Bible, the
edition of 1560, but imperfect, sold for 31<i>l.</i>; a manuscript
book of "Hours," with miniatures very prettily
painted, sold for 19<i>l.</i> As if to prove that the days
of bibliomania are not yet quite gone&mdash;a copy of
"Barnes's History of Edward III.," which in ordinary
condition is worth about 10<i>s.</i>, sold for the large sum of
9<i>l.</i> 10<i>s.</i>, simply because it happened to be in "choice
old blue morocco, the sides and back richly tooled."</p>

<hr />

<p>The election to the vacant chair of Greek in the
University of Edinburgh which took place on the 2d
of March, was contested with uncommon zeal. Up
to a late period it seemed undecided which of the
many able candidates for the office would win&mdash;but
at last the choice lay between Dr. William Smith,
Dr. Schmitz, Prof. Blackie, Prof. Macdowall, and
Mr. Price. The election was ultimately decided by
the Lord Provost giving a casting vote in favor of
Prof. Blackie. In this gentleman the University has
secured a man of genius, energy, and kindly feeling&mdash;and
one well able to maintain its character for
classical learning.</p>

<hr />

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dickens's</span> <i>Bleak House</i> is producing quite a
marked sensation in Germany. Half a dozen publishers
at least announced the work several weeks since,
and on the 30th of March the first number of <i>Bleak
House</i> was to appear in half a dozen German translations.
It remains to be seen what the German
translators will do with the Court of Chancery and
its technicalities.</p>

<hr />

<p>There are now about five or six various translations
of Macaulay's 'History of England' published
in Germany. The number is likely to be increased
by another translation, for which a Brunswick book-seller
has engaged the name of <span class="smcap">Herr Beseler</span> the
Schleswig-Holstein politician of the year 1848.</p>

<hr />

<p><span class="smcap">Barante</span> has published his third volume of the

<p><span class="smcap">Pierre Leroux</span>, who is now an exile in London,
is about to deliver a course of lectures on the <i>History
of Socialism</i>. Pierre Leroux has not only the necessary
erudition for the task, he has also the prestige
of having intimately known the modern Socialists.</p>

<hr />

<p>The works of <span class="smcap">Chamfort</span> are collected into one
octavo volume, with a preliminary essay by <span class="smcap">Arsene
Houssaye</span>. These writings abound in anecdotes,
and sharp sentences, picturesque, ear-catching, brief,
and suggestive phrases.</p>

<hr />

<p><span class="smcap">George Sand</span> has made another unsuccessful dramatic
experiment, <i>Pandolphe en vacances</i>, which distresses
the admirers of her genius, who desire to see
her renounce a stage to which that genius is clearly
not adapted, in spite of <i>Le Champi</i> and <i>Claudie</i>.</p>

<hr />

<p>In the <i>Revue des Deux Mondes</i> is commenced a
skillful translation of Mrs. <span class="smcap">Norton's</span> beautiful novel,
<i>Stuart of Dunleath</i>, by <span class="smcap">Emile Forgues</span>; and an intimation
is given of this vein being actively worked.</p>

<hr />

<p>No small sensation has been caused in Paris by
the discovery of the extraordinary forgeries of the
Shelley letters. The fact is, that the system of
forging letters and manuscripts of distinguished personages
is carried on to a large extent in that city:
indeed it is as much a regular branch of business as
the manufacture of pictures by the great masters is
in Italy. In Germany similar frauds are practiced
with great success. Only a little while ago a gentleman
purchased several letters purporting to be written
by Luther, every one of which it now appears is
a forgery. In Italy the same system is carried on.</p>

<hr />

<p>The literary remains of the late <span class="smcap">Anselm Feuerbach</span>,
the most learned of the professors of criminal
jurisprudence in Germany, are about to be edited by
his son, L. Feuerbach, and published by C. Wigand,
of Leipzig.</p>

<p>King Max of Bavaria has given a commission to
M. Halbig, the sculptor of Munich, to model from
the life a bust of Schelling, the well-known German
philosophical writer.</p>

<hr />

<p>The admirers of German literature will be glad to
learn that an attempt has been made in Germany
to register the enormous number of books and pamphlets
which the Germans themselves have published
on their two great poets, Goethe and Schiller. A
catalogue of the Goethe literature in Germany, from
the year 1793 to 1851, has been published by Balde,
at Cassel, and in London by Messrs. Williams and
Norgate. The Schiller literature, from 1781 to 1851,
is likewise announced by the same firm.</p>

<p>The literary remains of the late Count <span class="smcap">Platen-Hallermunde</span>,
author of <i>The Tower with Seven
Gates</i>, <i>The Romantic &OElig;dipus</i>, <i>The Fateful Fork</i>, and
other works, which will always stand pre-eminent in
German literature, as well as the poet's correspondence
with Count <span class="smcap">Fugger</span>, are now in the hands of
Dr. <span class="smcap">Minkvitz</span>, who is preparing them for publication.</p>

<hr />

<p>The first volume of <i>The Lives of the Sovereigns of
Russia, from Rurik to Nicholas</i>, is announced as nearly
ready in London. It is to be completed in three
volumes, and to be printed uniformly with Miss
Strickland's <i>Queens of England</i>, with illustrations.
The author, who is not unknown to fame, truly remarks,
"It is a singular fact that there is no such
work at present in the English language, and that we
know, perhaps, less of "Russia and the Russians,"
than we do of some of the distant tribes of India. It
does appear, therefore, that there is a blank in our
historical library which requires filling up; such a
publication, consequently, may be deemed a <i>desideratum</i>
in English literature."</p>

<h3>PENALTIES.</h3>

<p>The Penalty of buying cheap clothes, is the
same as that of going to law, the certainty
of losing your suit, and having to pay for it.</p>

<p>The Penalty of marrying is a mother-in-law.</p>

<p>The Penalty of remaining single, is having no
one who "cares a button" for you, as is abundantly
proved by the state of your shirts.</p>

<p>The Penalty of thin shoes, is a cold.</p>

<p>The Penalty of a pretty cook, is an empty larder.</p>

<p>The Penalty of stopping in Paris, is being shot.</p>

<p>The Penalty of tight boots, is corns.</p>

<p>The Penalty of having a haunch of venison
sent to you, is inviting a dozen friends to come
and eat it.</p>

<p>The Penalty of popularity, is envy.</p>

<p>The Penalty of a baby, is sleepless nights.</p>

<p>The Penalty of interfering between man and
wife, is abuse, frequently accompanied with blows,
from both.</p>

<p>The Penalty of a Godfather, is a silver knife,
fork, and spoon.</p>

<p>The Penalty of kissing a baby,
is half-a-crown (five shillings, if
you are liberal) to the nurse.</p>

<p>The Penalty of a public dinner,
is bad wine.</p>

<p>The Penalty of a legacy, or a
fortune, is the sudden discovery of
a host of poor relations you never
dreamt of, and of a number of
debts you had quite forgotten.</p>

<p>The Penalty of lending, is&mdash;with
a book or an umbrella, the certain
loss of it; with your name to a
bill, the sure payment of it; and
with a horse, the lamest chance of
ever seeing it back again sound.</p>

<p>The Penalty of being a witness,
is to be abused by the lawyers,
snubbed by the judge, and laughed
at by the spectators; besides having
the general state of your wardrobe
described in the papers next
morning.</p>

<h3>WHAT I HEARD ABOUT MYSELF IN THE EXHIBITION.</h3>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 420px;">
<img src="images/ill-1852-may_illo_26.jpg" width="420" height="600" alt="" />
</div>

<p>I am the original of the "Portrait
of a Gentleman," in the Exhibition
of last year. I had my likeness
taken, because I had a great admiration
for the original. I thought my
face handsome, and my figure noble,
if not elegant&mdash;I believed that I had
a remarkably grand head. I prided
myself on my eyes, not only on account
of their color, which I took
for a deep gray, but also for a lustre
which I fancied them to emit, which
I supposed was the fire of genius. I
was persuaded that I had a Roman
nose and a finely chiseled mouth.
Sometimes I thought I resembled
Byron, at others Shelley. It is true
I could not conceal from myself that
my proportions were rather massive
than lofty, and that my legs were
somewhat curved; but I imagined
that these peculiarities imparted a
stalwart manliness to my bearing.
While sitting to the artist I composed
my countenance into the most dignified
and intellectual expression of
which it was capable. I was represented
in full dress, and I thought I
presented the appearance of an Apollo&mdash;perhaps
a little too much developed&mdash;got
up for an evening party. I
was anxious that the public should
share my gratification, and had the
portrait sent to the Exhibition, where
it appeared on the Catalogue as the
"Portrait of a Gentleman." As soon
as the Exhibition was opened I went
there, and stationed myself before
my picture; a crowd was gathered
around. I thought, at first, that
they were admiring it as much as I did. I listened to
their criticisms, and was undeceived. "'Portrait of a
Gentleman!'" said one, "Portrait of a Snob!" and
passed on. I was indignant. "What could possess that
fellow; with his unmeaning face, fat paunch, and bandy
legs, to have his picture taken?" inquired another. My
head swam, I thought I should have fainted. "Vulgarity
personified;" "What a silly simper upon the face;"
"What a self-satisfied smirk about the mouth," remarked
a second, third, and fourth, as they cast their eyes
upon the picture. "The head is like a dumpling," said
a phrenological-looking visitor. "Why does he show that
fat hand so conspicuously?" asked a sixth. I was represented
standing with one leg crossed before the other,
my hand resting upon a book&mdash;which attitude I thought
harmonized with my remarkably intellectual countenance.
"The figure would pass for Sancho Panza, but the face
is too stupid," said a seventh. By this time I was almost
stupefied with humiliation; but the worst was yet to come.
Among those who were contemplating the portrait was a
lady&mdash;the loveliest, I think, I ever saw. "Poor fellow!"
said she, at last, with a sigh, "how dreadful it must be
for him to have those horrid green eyes!" I could bear
no more. I rushed from the Exhibition, and slunk to my
rooms. What I suffered that night I can not describe.
But the next day I recovered my senses; sent for my
picture from the Exhibition; and am now reconciled to
the fact that I am a very ugly-featured, bandy-legged
punchy little fellow, not the least in the world like an
Apollo.</p>

<h2>Spring Fashions.</h2>


<div class="figcenter" style="width: 571px;">

<span class="caption"><span class="smcap">Figures 1 and 2.&mdash;Ball and Visiting Toilet.</span></span>
</div>

<p>May is here with its bursting buds and early
flowers, but its fickleness overmatches that of
its imitator, Fashion, and foils all her attempts at adaptation
of costume for the carriage or the promenade.
To-day the sun smiles as in leafy June; to-morrow
cold, gray clouds lower upon the brow of the firmament,
and chilling winds chase the zephyrs back to
the orange groves of the South. To-day a light
dress is seasonable; to-morrow a cloak might not
be uncomfortable. It is difficult for the modiste to
designate the best costume for promenade; and to
avoid error, we will confine our report to fashion in
the parlor, drawing-room, and saloon.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fig. 1</span> represents a pretty <span class="smcap">Dinner</span> or <span class="smcap">Visiting
Toilet</span>. The head-dress is composed of blonde,
ribbon and white satin, velvet ribbon and white
feathers, and is worn very backward on the head.
The blonde forms a round with scalloped edge, covered
with figures. It is gathered in the middle, and
the gathers are concealed under a cross bow formed
of two loops of velvet and two of white satin, two
long ends of white ribbon (about fifteen inches) hang
down behind. On each side there are two white
feathers. The upper one is laid backward, and the
lower one comes forward. From between the two
proceed two velvet bows and a loose end. This little
Pompadour cap is the same on both sides. The
ribbons of the crown are No. 12; those of the sides
No. 3. Dress of <i>moire antique</i>, ornamented with
narrow velvet ribbons, about three-eighths of an inch
wide. Body plain, high, opening in front, edged with
two narrow velvets, the first three-eighths of an inch
wide. The opening is confined by five <i>moire</i> bands,
each with a bow of the same. The sleeves, rather
short, are bordered with five velvet ribbons. The
skirt is trimmed with two series of velvets. The
first begins six inches from the bottom, and is composed
of twenty rows. The second begins six inches
above the other, and contains fifteen. The rest of
the skirt is plain. The under-sleeves and habit-shirt
are lace.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fig. 2</span> is an elegant <span class="smcap">Ball Toilet</span>. Hair waved
and ornamented with a crown of small parti-colored
tulips; it inclines to the Mary Stuart form on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_864" id="Page_864">[Pg 864]</a></span>
head, and increases in size toward the bottom. Dress
of taffeta with <i>tulle</i> tunic and bertha. The body is
ornamented with a bertha, open in front, round behind;
this bertha, of <i>tulle</i> in small puffs, is trimmed
with clouded Pompadour white ribbon, No. 9. They
are placed in such a manner as to inclose the bertha
as if in a ring. The <i>tulle</i> skirt is also tucked up and
held by Pompadour ribbons, No. 16, which are set as
if they raised it and held it in long loops. At the
waist, these ribbons are plaited in with the plaits of
the skirt. The <i>tulle</i> skirt is puffed in very small
puffs. In the middle of the body are placed bows
of Pompadour ribbon, No. 9. On the left side there
is a beautiful fall of tulips with foliage; the silk skirt
is studded with bows of Pompadour ribbon, No. 12.</p>

<span class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 3.&mdash;Visiting Dress.</span></span>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Fig. 3</span> represent a beautiful <span class="smcap">Home</span> or <span class="smcap">Visiting
Toilet</span>. Velvet vest and skirt; waistcoat, watered
silk. The waistcoat reaches high, and is buttoned
from top to bottom. The vest sits close behind and
is open in front; it has a lapel turning up from the
bottom, and trimmed with a plaid satin ribbon, having
a velvet stripe in it. The sleeve is short, and
ends in a plaid cuff, open at the sides. The edges
of the lapel and the cuff are bound with a narrow
black velvet. The skirt is trimmed with three rows
of plaid ribbon, No. 22; the lowest is placed two
inches from the edge. The second and third are at
intervals of four inches from each other. A black
velvet, No. 2, is laid about half an inch from each
side of the ribbon. The collar is cambric, turning
down flat, rounded at bottom. Under the collar a
narrow black satin cravat is worn. The cambric
under-sleeves are plaited small, and form a puff, confined
by a narrow plain wristband, and terminated at
the hand by a plain open <i>manchette</i>, rounded off at the
corners, and held together by two jewel buttons connected
with a chain. This sleeve is very much like
the sleeves of a gentleman's shirt. A Matilda cap,
of blonde. It is set very backward on the head; the
crown is very small, and is drawn by a white watered
ribbon, which is tied on one side, where it hangs in
two ends. A branch of moss roses springs out of the
knot. The band of the cap, which is made of indented
blonde, is gathered, but short in front, whereas behind
it is gathered and long.</p>

<span class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 4.&mdash;Ball Toilet.</span></span>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Figure 4</span> represents
a portion of an elegant
<span class="smcap">Ball Dress</span>. Coiffure:
hair in bandeaux,
wreath of roses, small
bunches of grapes, and
satin ribbons with gold
figures. Under-dress,
white satin; the outer
one with two <i>tulle</i> skirts,
embroidered in spots
with silk, and trimmed
with ribbons. The satin
body is rather low
in front, and inclining
to the V shape; the
<i>tulle</i> body is open in
front down to the waist;
it is confined by four
small cords of silk and
gold, which are tied in
the middle, and terminate
in small silk and
gold tassels. The lower
one goes round the waist, like a sash, and the two
tassels fall at unequal distances rather low down the
skirt. The <i>tulle</i> body is gathered at the waist, in
front, and at the bottom of the back. It is also
gathered in the shoulder seam. Two ribbons are
sewed on the edge of the body, the second disappears
in the gathers. The satin sleeves are even and short;
those of <i>tulle</i> are open at the side and held by a
knotted cord. The large <i>tulle</i> skirt is trimmed at
bottom with five ribbons. The first is gathered at
the waist and arranged so as to drape in front and
reach down lower at the sides. The bottom of the
tunic is trimmed with three ribbons.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Caps.</span>&mdash;Those which are composed of English
point-lace, Valenciennes, or Mechlin, are principally
decorated with long streamers, or narrow ribbons,
about two inches wide, forming a mass of <i>petit coques</i>,
the ends of which being <i>frisot&eacute;s</i>, droop in a similar
way to the <i>gerb&eacute;s</i>. Sometimes these narrow ribbons
are colored and intermixed with various shades, which
gives them the name of the <i>touffes &agrave; la jardini&egrave;re</i>.
Pretty ones are formed of Brussels point, and decorated
with bunches of narrow gauze ribbon, green,
pink, blue, white, brown, yellow, &amp;c., twisted so as
to form clusters upon each side of the bands. The
little caps of the present day are mostly made in a
slight point just over the forehead, where it comes a
little forward, and rises upon each side just over the
temples. These caps are made rather long at the
ears.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Head-Dresses.</span>&mdash;Several very charming ones are
now worn, formed of black lace, and ornamented upon
the side with clusters of black velvet ribbon, richly
<i>broch&eacute;</i> in gold, and having long drooping ends floating
over the neck. We have also remarked several very
piquant coiffures in velvet, decorated with gold sequins,
so much in fashion now; while others of a
lighter description are of <i>tulle</i>, embroidered with gold,
and interlaced with chains of sequins, falling upon
each side of the neck, and decidedly making the most
aristocratic head-dress of the season. The wreaths
of flowers now intended for our young <i>&eacute;l&eacute;gantes</i>, are
also extremely pretty, some being formed of small
bell-flowers, which droop in a single row, quite over
the top of the forehead, while others have long sprays
falling over the back part of the head, having a very
novel effect.</p>
